```python

['up', 'up', 'left', 'left', 'left']

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence takes into account the previous actions and their effects on the game state. The key insights from the replays are:

- The `baba_obj` has moved one position to the right with each action.
- The `empty` object follows the `baba_obj` movement, suggesting it can be used to collect the object.

By analyzing the level layout, we can observe:

- The `baba_word` needs to be formed by connecting the `baba_obj` with other objects in a specific order.
- The `win_word` is the word that needs to be formed using the collected objects.

Therefore, the actions listed above guide the `baba_obj` to the correct position to connect with the remaining objects in the `baba_word` sequence, ultimately forming the `win_word`.
