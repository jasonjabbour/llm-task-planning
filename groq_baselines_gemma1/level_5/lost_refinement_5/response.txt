['right', 'right', 'up', 'down', 'left']

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence utilizes the knowledge of the level layout and the game's object interactions to achieve victory.

**Step 1: Analyze the Level Layout:**

- Identify the location of the 'baba_obj' (a required object to win) and the 'flag_word' (the goal to be reached).
- Note the locations of 'empty' cells (available for movement).

**Step 2: Consider Previous Actions and Replay Buffer:**

- Review the previous attempts and their replay buffer to identify patterns in the game state changes.
- Notice that previous attempts attempted to move the 'baba_obj' but were unsuccessful in reaching the 'flag_word'.

**Step 3: Plan Actions:**

- Move the 'baba_obj' one space to the right to reach a more favorable position.
- Move the 'baba_obj' one space to the right again to reach the 'flag_word'.
- Move the 'baba_obj' one space up to connect it with the 'flag_word'.
- Move one space down to claim victory and win the level.

This sequence of actions utilizes the level layout, object placement, and the game's interaction rules to successfully complete the level.
