```python

['right', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'right']

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence takes advantage of the game's mechanics and spatial layout of objects. 

* **Moving right:** The initial action immediately moves the player towards the 'baba_word' object, which is central to winning the level.


* **Moving right again:** This ensures the player ends up in the optimal position to reach the 'win_word' object.


* **Moving up twice:** This takes the player directly to the 'win_word' object.


* **Moving right one final time:** This ensures the player picks up the 'win_word' object and triggers the win condition.
