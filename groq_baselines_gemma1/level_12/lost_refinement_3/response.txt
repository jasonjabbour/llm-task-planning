```
['left', 'down', 'left']
```

**Explanation:**

The key to solving this level is to understand the relationships between the objects in the level and their interactions. By analyzing the history of your previous attempts, you can identify that the 'baba_obj' needs to be placed on the 'flag_obj' to win the level.

The actions proposed above are designed to:

1. **Position the 'baba_obj' correctly:**
    - The first 'left' action moves the 'baba_obj' one position to the left.
    - The 'down' action moves the 'baba_obj' one position down.
    - The final 'left' action positions the 'baba_obj' adjacent to the 'flag_obj'.


2. **Trigger the flag capture:**
    - The 'baba_obj' needs to be placed on the 'flag_obj' to capture it.


This sequence of actions ensures that the 'baba_obj' is placed on the 'flag_obj', completing the level.
