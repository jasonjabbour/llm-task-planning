```python

['down', 'up', 'right', 'right']

```

**Explanation:**

The key to winning this level is to return the lava creatures to their original positions. 

- By examining the history of previous attempts, we can see that the lava creatures were moved down to the bottom of the level. 
- The action sequence 'down, up' will move the 'lava_obj' back to its original position, at [1, 6]. 
- Once the lava creatures are back in their starting positions, the 'flag_word' can be collected by moving to [6, 1] and completing the level.
