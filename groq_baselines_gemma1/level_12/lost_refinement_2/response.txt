```python
['right', 'right', 'up', 'left', 'up', 'down']
```

**Explanation:**

Based on the state information provided, the key objects to focus on are the 'baba_obj' which needs to reach the 'flag_obj', and the lava. 

- The initial action sequence attempts to bring the 'baba_obj' up to the 'flag_obj', but it encounters a lava obstacle. 
- As the 'baba_obj' is currently in a position where it can reach the 'flag_obj' by moving right, the first three actions ('right') attempt to move the 'baba_obj' towards the 'flag_obj'. 
- It then attempts to move one step up, and then one step down to go around the lava obstacle. 
- Finally, the 'left' action is taken to bring the 'baba_obj' one space to the left, precisely to the coordinates of the 'flag_obj'.
