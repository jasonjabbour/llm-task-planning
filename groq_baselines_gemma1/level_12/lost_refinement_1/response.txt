```
['right', 'up', 'right', 'down', 'left']
```

**Explanation:**

The provided history reveals the player's unsuccessful attempts to reach the win condition. By analyzing the actions and their results, we can identify two crucial observations:

* The player has successfully placed the `baba_obj` in the correct location (top-right corner).
* The `win_word` (word formed by the `is_word` and `hot_word`) has not been completed.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to move the `baba_obj` one position to the right to form the `win_word`.

This action sequence aligns with the game's rules and allows the player to complete the level.
