```python

['down', 'right', 'right', 'down']

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the state provided and the history of actions taken, the key observation is the location of the `baba_obj` and the `flag_word`. 

- The `baba_obj` is currently at [2, 5], and the `flag_word` is at [6, 8]. 
- Remember that the `baba_obj` can only move in the directions specified by the `UTILS` dictionary.

By analyzing the previous actions and their results, it seems like the `baba_obj` needs to move one position down and then two positions to the right to reach the `flag_word` location.

Therefore, the optimal sequence of actions to win the level is:

1. **Down:** Move the `baba_obj` one position down to [2, 4].
2. **Right:** Move the `baba_obj` two positions to the right to [4, 5].
3. **Right:** Move the `baba_obj` one position to the right to [5, 5].
4. **Down:** Move the `baba_obj` one position down to reach the [6, 5] location and win the level.
