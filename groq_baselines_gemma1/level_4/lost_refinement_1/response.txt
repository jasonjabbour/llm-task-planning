```python

['right', 'right', 'up', 'down']

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the state information and history of previous actions, the updated state of the `baba_obj` is at `[6, 5]`. The goal is to reach the `win_word` which is `[8, 8]`. 

By looking at the `UTILS` dictionary, we can determine that:

- Moving one step to the `right` would bring the `baba_obj` to `[7, 5]`, which is one step away from the `win_word`.
- Moving one step `up` would move the `baba_obj` to `[6, 7]`, which is two steps away from the `win_word`.
- Moving one step `down` would move the `baba_obj` to `[6, 4]`, which is three steps away from the `win_word`.

Therefore, the optimal action sequence to win the level is to first move one step to the `right`, then move one step `right` again, then move one step `up`, and finally move one step `down` to reach the `win_word` and win the level.
