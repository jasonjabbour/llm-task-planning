```python

[ 'down', 'left', 'up', 'right' ]

```

**Explanation:**

Analysis of the previous attempts reveals a consistent pattern of the object "baba_obj" being moved one space to the right, then one space down. 

- The initial state of the object is at (2, 5). 
- In the winning sequence, the object is ultimately landed at (5, 5). 
- By observing the movement, it can be deduced the object needs to move one space down and then one space to the left.

Therefore, the corrected action sequence is: 
1) Move one space down 
2) Move one space to the left.
