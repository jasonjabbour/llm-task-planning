```python

['right', 'right', 'up', 'down', 'right', 'left']

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence takes into account the previous action sequences that were attempted and the resulting state changes. By analyzing the game state and the history of attempted actions, we can identify the following key insights:

- The 'baba_obj' is currently located at (6, 5). 
- The 'win_word' is located at (8, 8).
- During previous attempts, the object has been moved one space to the right multiple times, but it has never been moved closer to the 'win_word'.

Therefore, the corrected action sequence starts by moving the 'baba_obj' one space to the right to reach (7, 5). Then, it moves up, down, and finally one space to the right to reach the 'win_word' at (8, 8).
