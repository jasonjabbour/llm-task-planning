```

['up', 'right', 'right']

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the previous action replays, we can observe the movement of the `baba_obj` is towards the right. From the state provided, the `baba_obj` is at `[2, 5]`. To win the level, it needs to reach `[8, 8]`.

The action sequence 'up', 'right', 'right' will move the `baba_obj` from `[2, 5]` to `[8, 8]`, completing the level. This action sequence is valid as all the moves are within the gameboard boundaries and do not collide with any other objects.
