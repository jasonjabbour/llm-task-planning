```python

['right', 'left', 'down', 'left', 'right']

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the game state and the previous attempts, the winning strategy involves collecting the flag object while avoiding obstacles and reaching the winning position.

* The first `right` action is consistent with the previous attempts and movement towards the flag object. 
* To avoid the obstacle at (3, 5), the next action is `left`.
* Subsequently, `down` and `left` actions are needed to reach the flag object and collect it.
* Finally, a `right` action is required to reach the winning position (8, 8).
