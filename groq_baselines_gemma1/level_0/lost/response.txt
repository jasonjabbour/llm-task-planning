## Actions to win the level:

```
["up", "up", "right", "left", "left", "up", "right", "right", "left"]
```

**Explanation:**

1. Move the `baba_obj` **up** twice to pick it up.
2. Move the `baba_obj` **right** to reach the starting position of the word `win_word`.
3. Move the `baba_obj` **left** one step.
4. Move the `baba_obj` **left** one more step.
5. Move the `baba_obj` **up** one step.
6. Move the `baba_obj` **right** two steps.
7. Move the `baba_obj` **right** one more step.
8. Move the `baba_obj` **left** one step.

This sequence of actions will collect the `baba_word` and the `win_word` and fulfill the level's win condition.
