```python

['right', 'right', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down']

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence utilizes a combination of movement and word placement strategies to successfully complete the level.

1. **Movement:** The initial actions focus on moving the 'baba_obj' to the right until it reaches the center of the board.


2. **Word Positioning:** When the 'baba_obj' is in the center, the sequence moves up two rows to place the 'baba_word' correctly on the board.


3. **Final Actions:** The actions then move the 'baba_obj' one row down and one column to the right to complete the level's word placement requirement.

This corrected sequence of actions utilizes the game's state information, the history of previous actions and their outcomes, and the available action space to achieve the goal of completing the level.
