```python

['down', 'down', 'right', 'left']

```

**Explanation:**

* Based on the previous attempts, we can observe a pattern in the object movement. The flag object is moving diagonally down and to the right.
* The current state of the flag object is at (7, 4), and the win word is at (8, 8).
* Therefore, the agent needs to move the flag object diagonally up and to the right until it reaches the win word's position.
* The series of actions 'down, down, right, left' will move the flag object to the desired location.
