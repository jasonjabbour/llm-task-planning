```python

['right', 'right', 'up', 'left', 'right']

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the state information provided, the player's goal is to spell the word "baba". The previous attempts suggest that the player has been trying to move the object "baba_obj" around the board.

The correct action sequence starts with moving the "baba_obj" two cells to the right, then moving one cell up, then one cell to the left, and finally one cell to the right. This sequence of actions will spell out the word "baba" and win the level.
