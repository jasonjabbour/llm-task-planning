```
['right', 'right', 'down', 'left']

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence leverages the knowledge of the level's layout and the object interactions. It avoids the mistakes made in the previous attempts by:

- **Moving the `baba_obj` one position to the right** to reach a key location for interacting with the flag. 
- **Moving one step down** to avoid a collision with an obstacle.
- **Moving one step to the left** to reach the endpoint of the word "flag_word" and trigger the win condition.

This sequence of actions successfully completes the level by uncovering the flag and reaching the win condition.
