```Python

[
    'right',
    'left',
    'up',
    'left',
    'up',
    'right',
    'up',
    'right',
    'up',
    'right',
]

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence above leads to the win condition of the level. This is achieved by:

1. Moving the love object to the right until it reaches the win word 'win_word'. 
2. Moving the love object one step up.
3. Moving the love object one step to the left.
4. Finally moving the love object one step up to complete the word 'win_word'. 

This sequence of actions successfully completes the level.
