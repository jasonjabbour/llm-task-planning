['left', 'up', 'left', 'up', 'right', 'up']

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence utilizes the newly available information from the previous attempts to achieve the win condition. 

- The actions start with **left** to move the love object to a better position for the next step.
- **Up** is then taken to move the love object one step closer to its desired final position.
- **Left** moves the love object one step further to a more optimal location. 
- **Up** is taken again to move the love object to its final position next to the flag object.
