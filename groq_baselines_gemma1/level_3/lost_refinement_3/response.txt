```Python

['left', 'down', 'left', 'up']

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the state information provided, the optimal action sequence to win the level is as follows:

1. **Move left:** This action helps to move the 'love_obj' closer to the 'flag_obj', which is the goal of the level.


2. **Move down:** This action allows the 'flag_obj' to reach an empty space.


3. **Move left:** This action brings the 'love_obj' closer to the 'flag_obj'.


4. **Move up:** This action allows the 'flag_obj' to reach its desired position and triggers the level completion.

**Note:** The previous attempts you mentioned involved either not moving the 'love_obj' or failing to position the 'flag_obj' correctly. This action sequence addresses both of these issues and leads to the successful completion of the level.
