```python

['left', 'up', 'left', 'up']

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the replay buffer and history of previous actions, the object `love_obj` has moved from `[7, 3]` to `[7, 7]`, and the `flag_obj` has moved from `[7, 6]` to `[8, 6]`. 

The goal is to complete the word `win_word` which requires `love_obj` to be at `[3, 8]` and `flag_obj` to be at `[6, 8]`.

By looking at the action space, we can see that the only actions that can move `love_obj` towards `[3, 8]` are `left` and `up`. However, since `love_obj` is already at `[7, 7]`, the optimal action is to first move `love_obj` one step up to `[7, 8]`. Then, move `love_obj` two steps to the left to `[3, 8]`.

This sequence of actions will ultimately lead to completing the word `win_word` and winning the level.
