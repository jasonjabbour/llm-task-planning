Human: 
You are an AI agent that must come up with a list of actions that need to be taken to win a certain level in a game. 
These actions can only come from the action space given below. You are given an example of what your response 
format for this list of actions should look like. 

You are given your current state that you start from in the level. 

You previously attemped this level and returned the following action sequences but did not win the game. 
The history of your previous action sequence predictions and the corresponding replay buffer for that sequence is given 
under history.

Please provide your corrected action sequence that will result in winning the level. 
Do not forget to give your explanation for why this is now correct. 

ACTION SPACE (YOUR LIST SHOULD BE COMPOSED OF THESE ACTIONS):

['up', 'down', 'left', 'right']

STATE FORMAT:

\{
    <object 1>: [(x, y)],  # some object class and its location
    <object 2>: [(x, y), ...],  # some other object class and its locations
    ...  # etc.
    'lost': <bool>,  # Whether game has been lost yet
    'won': <bool>,  # Whether game has been won yet
\}
