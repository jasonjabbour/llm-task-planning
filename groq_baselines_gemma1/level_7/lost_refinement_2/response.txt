```

**Explanation:**

Based on the state information provided, the player's objective is to reach the flag (represented by `flag_obj`) at [5, 4] and spell the word "win". 

**Action Sequence:**

* **Move the `keke_obj` one space to the left:** This is necessary to ensure that the `keke_obj` is in the correct position to form the word "win".
* **Move the `baba_obj` one space up:** This is necessary to create the letter "w" in the word "win".
* **Move the `flag_obj` one space to the right:** This allows the player to pick up the flag.
* **Move the `flag_obj` one space up:** This completes the word "win" and triggers the win condition.

This action sequence ensures that the player can spell the word "win" and win the level.
