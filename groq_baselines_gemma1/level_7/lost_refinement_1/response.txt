```

['left', 'down', 'left', 'right']

```

**Explanation:**

* The key to solving this level is to correctly align the keke_word and the flag_word. 
* By analyzing the replay buffer, we can see that the player has previously moved keke_obj one space to the right and one space down, but it didn't result in victory. 
* This means the keke_word needs to be rotated one position counterclockwise. 
* Moving the keke_obj one space down and then one space to the left will ultimately align it with the flag_word, completing the level.
