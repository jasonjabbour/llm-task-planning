```Python

['left', 'down', 'up', 'right']

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the state information and the history of previous actions, the corrected action sequence is to first move **left** to reach a location where the word "keke" can be formed. Then, move **down** to pick up the object "keke_obj". Then, move **up** to reach a position where the word "baba" can be formed. Finally, move **right** to reach the finish location and win the level.

This action sequence considers the following factors:

- The location of the objects needed to form the words "keke" and "baba".
- The previously attempted actions and their outcomes.
- The history of the actions and their effects on the state of the game.

By following this action sequence, the AI agent can successfully win the level.
