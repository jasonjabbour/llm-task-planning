```python
['left', 'up', 'up', 'right']
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Move left:** This action positions the player directly beside the 'keke_word,' which is the word that needs to be spelled to win.


2. **Move up twice:** This action raises the player above the 'keke_obj,' allowing the word to be spelled without interference.


3. **Move right:** This action positions the player above the first letter of the 'win_word,' which is the word associated with the 'flag_obj.'


4. **Move up:** This action ensures the player is directly above the 'win_word,' completing the level.
