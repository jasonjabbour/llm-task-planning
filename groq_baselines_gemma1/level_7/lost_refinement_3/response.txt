```Python

['left', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'left', 'down', 'up']

```

**Explanation:**

- Based on the state and history of actions, the object we need to move is the `baba_obj` located at `[3, 4]`.
- The `baba_obj` needs to reach the `flag_obj` located at `[5, 4]`.
- The `baba_obj` can only move to the `up` and `down` directions.
- The action sequence starts by moving the `baba_obj` one step to the `left` to avoid a collision with the `keke_obj`.
- The `baba_obj` then moves one step `up` to reach the `flag_obj`.
