```python

["left", "up", "up"]

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the previous replays, it appears that the key to winning the level is to move the keke_obj to the flag_obj's location, which is at (6, 1). 

- The first action, `left`, is to ensure we reach the middle of the map.
- The second action, `up`, moves the keke_obj closer to the flag_obj.
- The final action, `up` again, brings the keke_obj to the flag_obj's location, completing the level.
