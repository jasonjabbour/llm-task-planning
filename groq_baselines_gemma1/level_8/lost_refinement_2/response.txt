```python

['right', 'left', 'up', 'down', 'right']

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence addresses the following observations from the previous attempts:

* The player's progress is stuck near the right side of the level, suggesting that the game state requires navigating through the wall objects to reach the win condition.
* The previous attempts did not attempt to move the 'baba_obj' which is controllable and could provide a path through the wall.

Therefore, the corrected action sequence starts by going right to reach the 'baba_obj', then left to pick it up. It then involves executing a series of actions to move the 'baba_obj' through the wall objects and ultimately reach the exit (win_word) at the top of the level.
