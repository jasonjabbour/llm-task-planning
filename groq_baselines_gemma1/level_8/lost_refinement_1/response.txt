```python

['right', 'right', 'up', 'left']

```

**Explanation:**

* The initial state indicates the flag is located at (6, 1) and the player's word is "baba". 
* The previous actions attempted by the AI resulted in the player object being moved around the map without reaching the flag.
* The corrected action sequence utilizes the learned map layout and the location of the flag to guide the AI towards the flag. 
* The AI first moves right to reach the right side of the map, then moves right again to ensure it is in the optimal position to access the path to the flag. 
* Then, the AI moves up to reach the row of the flag, and finally moves left to pick up the flag and win the level.
