```python

['left', 'up', 'right', 'down']

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the previous action attempts and the replay buffer, it can be observed that the 'baba_obj' is stuck in a loop at (6, 4). 

The solution is to move the 'baba_obj' one step to the left using 'left' action, then move one step up using 'up' action, then one step to the right using 'right' action, and finally move one step down using 'down' action. This brings the 'baba_obj' to the desired location (5, 4), and the level can be completed.
