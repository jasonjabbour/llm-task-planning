```python

['right', 'right', 'up', 'left', 'up']

```

**Explanation:**

The key to solving this level is to manipulate the 'baba_obj' to reach the 'flag_obj'. 

* The first three actions ('right', 'right', 'up') move the 'baba_obj' to the top right corner of the level, ensuring it does not intersect with any insurmountable objects.
* The next two actions ('left' and 'up') strategically move the 'baba_obj' closer to the 'flag_obj'.

This sequence of actions leads to the 'baba_obj' intersecting with and collecting the 'flag_obj', resulting in the 'win_word' being completed and the level being won.
