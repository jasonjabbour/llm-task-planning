```python

["right", "left", "down", "right", "up", "down", "right", "left"]

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the previous attempts and the state information provided, the optimal action sequence to win the level is as follows:

- Move the `baba_obj` to the right to reach a favorable location.
- Move the `baba_obj` to the left to avoid an obstacle.
- Move the `baba_obj` down to reach the `flag_obj` and the `flag_word`.
- Move the `baba_obj` right to reach the `win_word`.
- Move the `baba_obj` up to finish the level.
- Move the `baba_obj` down to avoid a barrier.
- Move the `baba_obj` right to reach the finish position.

This action sequence will allow the player to collect the flag, complete the word, and win the level.
