```python

['left', 'down', 'left', 'up']

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the state information and the previous attempts, we can identify a pattern in the enemy movement and the object locations. The key is to prioritize moving the Baba object to a position where it can reach the win_word without being trapped by the enemies.

* **Move left:** This action allows the Baba object to move out of its previous position and create space for the win_word.
* **Move down:** This action allows the Baba object to reach the win_word's row.
* **Move left:** This action positions the Baba object adjacent to the win_word.
* **Move up:** This action aligns the Baba object with the first letter of the win_word, completing the level.

This action sequence ensures that the Baba object reaches the win_word without getting trapped by the enemies and completes the level.
