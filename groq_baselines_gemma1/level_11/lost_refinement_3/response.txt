```

['left', 'down', 'left', 'up', 'right']

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the provided state and history of actions, the corrected action sequence is to move **left**, then **down**, then **left**, then **up**, and finally **right**. 

This sequence of actions addresses the following key aspects of the level:

- **Movement of the controlled object:** The actions guide the "baba_obj" to a position where it can interact with the win condition.


- **Interaction with game objects:** The sequence of actions leads to interacting with the "win_word" object, which is required to win the level.


- **Movement restrictions:** The "controllables" list indicates that the "baba_obj" is the only object that can be controlled. The actions respect this restriction and utilize only the "baba_obj" for movement.

This action sequence takes into account the previous attempts and their outcomes, avoiding the pitfalls of those attempts and leading to a successful win.
