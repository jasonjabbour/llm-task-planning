```Python

['right', 'left', 'up', 'right']

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence identifies and retrieves the flag object, guiding the character toward victory. 

- The initial analysis of the level reveals the flag object is at (1, 7) and the character's starting location is (0, 0).
- The actions sequence begins with moving one square to the right to reach (1, 0), ensuring the character is closer to the flag object.
- The sequence then involves moving one square upwards to reach (1, 7), securing the flag and completing the level.
