```python

['right', 'left', 'up', 'down', 'left', 'up']

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the state information provided and the history of previous actions, the corrected action sequence involves moving to the right, then left, then up, down, and finally left. 

- The initial movement to the right helps position the player to better access the objective in the top right corner.
- Subsequent movements ensure the player reaches the flag object and collects it, satisfying the winning condition.


This action sequence differs from previous attempts as it incorporates the learned information that collecting the flag object in the upper right corner is crucial to win the level.
