```

["up", "up", "right", "down", "right", "left"]

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence utilizes the information gleaned from the previous attempts to navigate the level.

* The first `up` action ensures the player avoids colliding with the tall rock object.
* Two consecutive `up` actions are performed to reach the elevated empty slot above the starting position.
* The `right` action positions the player next to the flag object without colliding with any obstacles.
* The `down` action picks up the rock object without losing the flag.
* The final `right` action positions the player on the starting point of the word "baba" (indicated by the `baba_word` object). This action unlocks the flag word and completes the level.

This action sequence avoids the pitfalls encountered in the previous attempts. The player picks up objects in the correct order, avoids colliding with obstacles, and positions themselves correctly to finish the level.
