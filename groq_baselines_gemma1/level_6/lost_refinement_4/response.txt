```python

['right', 'right', 'up', 'left', 'left', 'up']

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence addresses the following issues identified in the previous attempts:

* The previous actions did not prioritize picking up the flag object, which is crucial to win the level.
* The previous actions did not consider the position of the player's word and the flag word in relation to the rock word.

The updated action sequence ensures the following:

* The robot picks up the flag object as soon as possible.
* The robot strategically positions itself to complete the word puzzle by aligning the rock word with the flag word and the player's word in the correct order.

By following this action sequence, the robot can successfully complete the level by forming the win word and collecting the flag.
