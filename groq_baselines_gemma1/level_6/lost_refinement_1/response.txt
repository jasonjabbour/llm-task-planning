[ 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'right' ]

```

**Explanation:**

Upon reviewing the state and history information provided, we can identify key patterns and constraints within the level's mechanics.

- The objective is to collect the "win_word" object, which is currently located at [8, 8].
- The "baba_obj" object, which is controlled by the agent, is currently at [2, 4].
- The level layout includes obstacles and interactive objects, which can be used to navigate and reach the win word.

Our action sequence takes into account these factors:

- The first `up` action allows the "baba_obj" to move closer to the row where the "win_word" is located.
- Subsequent `up` and `right` actions lead the "baba_obj" towards the `win_word` without colliding with any obstacles.

This sequence of actions strategically positions the `baba_obj` to collect the `win_word` and complete the level.
