```python

[ 'right', 'right', 'down', 'up' ]

```

**Explanation:** 

Analysis of the previous attempts shows a consistent pattern where the 'baba_obj' is moved one position up and one position to the right in each attempt. The final state of the previous attempts had the 'baba_obj' at [4, 6], which led to the player not completing the level.

The action sequence suggested above deviates from the previous attempts by rotating the movement of the 'baba_obj' one position clockwise. This ensures the 'baba_obj' ends up at the correct location ( [5, 6] ) to complete the level.
