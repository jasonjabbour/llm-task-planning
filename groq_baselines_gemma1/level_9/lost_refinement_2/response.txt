```

["left", "up", "down", "left"]

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence is based on the observation that the skull object, which is needed to win the level, is currently located in the top-left corner of the level. 

1. **Move the skull to the left:** This action is necessary to bring the skull closer to the win word.


2. **Move the skull up:** This action will position the skull directly above the win word 'win_word'.


3. **Move the skull down:** This action will bring the skull into contact with the win word.


4. **Move the skull to the left:** This action will ensure that the skull is in the correct position to complete the word and win the level.
