```python

['right', 'down', 'up', 'left']

```

**Explanation:**

* Based on the state information provided, the object we need to reach is the flag object located at (6, 5).
* From the previous attempts, we can see that the `baba_obj` has been moved in a clockwise direction. 
* Therefore, to reach the flag object, we need to move the `baba_obj` in a counterclockwise direction.
* The action sequence that will achieve this is `right`, `down`, `up`, `left`.
