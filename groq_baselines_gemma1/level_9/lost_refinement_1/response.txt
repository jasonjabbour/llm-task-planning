```python

['right', 'up', 'right']

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the state information provided, the key objects are the skull and flag objects. 

- The skull object needs to be positioned next to the 'win_word' ([[8, 1]]). 
- The flag object needs to be positioned next to the 'flag_word' ([[6, 1]]).

The actions sequence above first moves the skull object one position to the right to the desired position next to the 'win_word'. Then, it moves the flag object one position up to the desired position next to the 'flag_word'.
