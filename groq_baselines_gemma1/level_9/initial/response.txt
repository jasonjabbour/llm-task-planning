**Reasoning:**

1. **Move the skull object to its word location:** 
    - The skull object needs to be moved to the location specified by the `skull_word` list `[[1, 7]]`. 


2. **Move the skull object to the skull object location:** 
    - The skull object needs to be moved to one of the multiple locations specified by the `skull_obj` list. This will allow the player to collect the skull object.


3. **Move the flag object to its word location:** 
    - The flag object needs to be moved to the location specified by the `flag_word` list `[[6, 1]]`. 


4. **Move the flag object to the finish location:** 
    - The flag object needs to be moved to the location `[8, 1]` to win the level.

**Note:** This action sequence was chosen based on the initial state of the level and the constraints of the game. It ensures that the player can collect the necessary objects and complete the level.
