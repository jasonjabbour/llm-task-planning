```python
[ 'right', 'left', 'up', 'down', 'left', 'up', 'right', 'up' ]
```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence utilizes the knowledge of the level layout and the movement capabilities of the controllable object (baba_obj) to guide it towards the winning word 'win_word'.

* **First, we move the baba_obj one step to the right** to reach a more central position in the grid.


* **Then, we move one step to the left** to avoid an obstruction and create a more efficient path.


* **We then move  up one step** to reach a position adjacent to the 'win_word'.


* **We finally move down one step** to land on the 'win_word', completing the level.

This action sequence takes into account the game rules, the available actions, and the current state of the level to achieve the goal of reaching and aligning the 'baba_word' with the 'win_word'.
