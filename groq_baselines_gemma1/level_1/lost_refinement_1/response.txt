```
['right', 'right', 'up', 'left']
```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence utilizes the knowledge of the game state, the history of previous actions, and the available actions to reach the win condition. 

* **First two rights:** The initial actions move the "baba_obj" one space to the right twice, positioning it closer to the "win_word."
* **Up action:** The subsequent up action positions the object one space above its current position, aligning with the "win_word."
* **Final left action:** The final left action precisely aligns the "baba_obj" with the "win_word," completing the word and triggering the winning condition.

This sequence of actions takes advantage of the object movement rules and win condition requirements, leading to successful completion of the level.
