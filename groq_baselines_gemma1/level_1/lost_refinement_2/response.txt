```python

['left', 'left', 'up']

```

**Explanation:**

The provided history reveals an attempt to reach the flag object (located at [7, 4]) by moving the controllable object (baba_obj) in a circular pattern. However, this approach did not lead to success.

Upon further inspection of the level layout and the history, it becomes evident that the word "win_word" (necessary to win the level) is located at [8, 8]. Also, the flag object is one step to the left of the winning word.

Therefore, the corrected action sequence is to:

1. Move the baba_obj **left** to reach the flag object.
2. Move the baba_obj **left** again to reach the winning word.
3. Move the baba_obj **up** to claim the win_word and win the level.
