['left', 'down', 'left', 'up', 'left']
```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence accounts for the previous actions taken and their effects on the game state. 

- The initial attempt identified the need to move the `baba_obj` to reach the `win_word`. 
- The subsequent attempts focused on manipulating the position of the `baba_obj` without considering the arrangement of the `empty` objects, which is crucial for the word formation.
- The corrected sequence starts by moving the `baba_obj` one position to the left, then moves one square down to ensure that the `baba_obj` is above the `win_word`. 
- The sequence then moves one space to the left and one space up, completing the word `baba` by aligning it with the `win_word`.
