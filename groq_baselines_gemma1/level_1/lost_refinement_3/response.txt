['right', 'right', 'down', 'left', 'up', 'up']

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence utilizes knowledge from the level's layout and the AI's understanding of object positions and movement. 

* The initial action sequence attempts to move the 'baba_obj' towards the 'flag_obj', but it ends up getting stuck.
* The corrected sequence starts by moving the 'baba_obj' one step to the right to avoid an obstacle. 
* It then moves the 'baba_obj' two steps to the right, enabling it to reach the 'flag_obj'.
* The AI then instructs the 'baba_obj' to move down, and then to the left, ensuring it reaches the 'flag_obj' and completes the level.
