```

['right', 'left', 'down', 'up']

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the state provided, the key object of interest is the 'baba_obj'. By reviewing the history of previous attempts, we can see that the 'baba_obj' has been moved to various locations but ultimately ended up at its starting position. 

This suggests that the game might require a specific sequence of movements to trigger the win condition. 

Using the action space provided, we can determine that moving the 'baba_obj' one step to the right and then one step to the left would bring it to the correct location to complete the word 'baba'. We then need to move one step down and finally one step up to reach the 'win_word' position.
