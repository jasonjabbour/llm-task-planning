```python
['up', 'right', 'right', 'down']
```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence utilizes the information gathered from the previous attempts to avoid making the same mistakes. 

- The object "baba_obj" needs to be moved to the word "win_word" which is at location [8, 1]. 
- The action sequence ensures that the "baba_obj" is moved up, then right twice, and finally down to reach the desired location.
