```
['up', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'left', 'up']

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the provided state and history, we can observe that the player's current position of the `baba_obj` is at (6, 4). The goal is to reach the `win_word` which is located at (8, 1), which requires the player to move in a specific direction sequence.

By analyzing the previous actions, we can identify that the player has already attempted to move in various directions around the object. However, it has not been able to reach the win_word.

By examining the map and the object locations, we can realize that the optimal path to win the game is to move the `baba_obj` one step up and then two steps to the right. This sequence of actions will lead the `baba_obj` to the `win_word` location.

Therefore, the action sequence `['up', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'left', 'up']` will allow the player to reach the `win_word` and win the level.
