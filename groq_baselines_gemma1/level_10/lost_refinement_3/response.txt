```Python

['right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down']

```

**Explanation:**

The key insight to winning this level is to collect the flag object while avoiding the goop objects. From the previous attempts, we can see that the player failed to collect the flag. 

- The first three actions in the corrected sequence ensure the player reaches the flag object (at location [7, 7]). 
- The subsequent two actions guide the player to move in a clockwise direction, avoiding the goop objects (located at [6, 2] and other surrounding cells). 
- This strategy ensures the player avoids the harmful goop objects while successfully collecting the flag and ultimately winning the level.
