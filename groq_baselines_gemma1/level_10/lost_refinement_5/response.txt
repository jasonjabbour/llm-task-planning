```Python

['right', 'right', 'up', 'right', 'up', 'left', 'down']

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the previous attempts and the current state of the level, the optimal actions are as follows:

- Move the `baba_obj` one step to the right.
- Move the `baba_obj` one step to the right.
- Move the `baba_obj` one step up.
- Move the `baba_obj` one step to the right.
- Move the `baba_obj` one step up.
- Move the `baba_obj` one step to the left.
- Move the `baba_obj` one step down.

These actions will align the `baba_obj` with the `win_word` allowing the player to win the level.
