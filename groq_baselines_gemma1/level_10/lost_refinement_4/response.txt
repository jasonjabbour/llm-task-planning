```Python

['right', 'right', 'up', 'right']

```

**Explanation:**

The key to solving this level is to keep the control of the `baba_word` and the `flag_word` in the center of the grid. 

1. Move the `baba_word` one position to the right until it reaches the center of the grid (column 5).


2. While the `flag_word` is not aligned horizontally with the `baba_word`, move the `baba_word` one position up.


3. When the `flag_word` is aligned horizontally with the `baba_word`, move the `flag_word` one position to the right.


4. Finally, move the `baba_word` one position down to its final position.
