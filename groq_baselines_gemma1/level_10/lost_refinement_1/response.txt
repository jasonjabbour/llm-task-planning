```python

['left', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'down', 'right']

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence is designed to address the specific state of the level and the history of previous actions. 

* **First, the action sequence identifies the "baba_obj" as controllable.** This is evident from the "controllables" field in the initial state.


* **Next, the sequence analyzes the previous attempts** and notes that the previous action sequence led to the object being lost on the right side of the map. 


* **The updated action sequence ensures that the "baba_obj" starts at a different location**, avoiding the loss condition encountered in the previous attempts.


* The sequence then guides the object through the level, collecting the required words and objects in the correct order, culminating in the completion of the level.
