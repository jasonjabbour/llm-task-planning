```python
["up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "up", "right", "down", "right", "right"]
```

2. Move the `baba_obj` one position to the right to stand next to the `flag_word`.
3. Move the `baba_obj` up 6 times to reach the `win_word`.
4. Move the `baba_obj` one position to the right to claim the win and win the level.
