```python

["left", "down", "down", "left", "up", "left", "right"]

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the given history, it can be observed that the "baba_obj" (an object that needs to be moved to win the level) has been moving counter-clockwise around a square path. The most recent attempt ended with the object at `(7, 6)`. 

The correct sequence of actions is to:

1. Move the "baba_obj" one position to the left, to `(6, 6)`.
2. Move the "baba_obj" two positions down to `(6, 4)`.
3. Move the "baba_obj" one position to the left, to `(5, 4)`.
4. Move the "baba_obj" one position up to `(5, 5)`.
5. Move the "baba_obj" one position to the left, to `(4, 5)`.
6. Move the "baba_obj" one position to the right to reach the goal position `(4, 4)`.

This sequence of actions will result in the "baba_obj" reaching its target position, completing the level.
