```python

['up', 'up', 'right']

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the provided state, history, and action space, the optimal action sequence to win the level is to move the `baba_obj` up two spaces, and then move it one space to the right.

This sequence of actions allows the player to reach the winning word `[2, 4]`, which is the goal of the level. This solution is confirmed by the lack of any collision or other obstacles in the provided state.
