['right', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'up']

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected action sequence is derived from analyzing the previous attempts and their replay buffers. The key insights from the replays are:

* The 'baba_obj' has been moving clockwise consistently.
* The 'baba_obj' has been reaching the boundaries of the level, suggesting the need to move in a different direction.
* The 'empty' object, which is crucial for completing the level, has been consistently moving one space down.

Based on these observations, the corrected sequence starts by moving the 'baba_obj' one space to the right to avoid hitting the level boundaries. It then moves the 'baba_obj' down two spaces to reach the 'empty' object. It then moves one space to the left to pick up the 'empty' object. Finally, it moves the 'baba_obj' one space up to complete the level.
