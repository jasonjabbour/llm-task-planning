```Python

['up', 'up', 'right', 'right']

```

**Explanation:**

Based on the history of previous actions and the current state, we can observe a pattern in the position of the `baba_obj`. The object consistently moves one step up and then one step to the right before reaching its final position. 

Therefore, the optimal action sequence to win the level is to move the `baba_obj` one step up twice, and then one step to the right twice to reach the winning position at `[2, 4]`.
