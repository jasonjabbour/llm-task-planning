```python

['right', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'right']

```

**Explanation:**

The analysis of the previous attempts and the current state reveals the following crucial information:

- The win condition requires the player to form the word "baba".
- The "baba_obj" object is crucial for creating the word "baba".
- The object is initially located at (5, 4).

Therefore, the optimal action sequence is to move the "baba_obj" towards the cell (2, 4), which is the location of the remaining letter 'b' required to form the word "baba".

The sequence of actions to achieve this is:

1. Move one cell to the right.
2. Move one cell to the right.
3. Move one cell up.
4. Move one cell up.
5. Move one cell to the right.
