## Actions to win the level:

```
["up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]
```

**Explanation:**

1. Move the highlighted 'baba_obj' **up** twice to reach the starting position of the 'win_word'.
2. Move the 'baba_obj' **right** for 10 steps to position it directly above the 'win_word'.
3. The 'win_word' itself is already in its final position, so no further action is needed to complete the level.
