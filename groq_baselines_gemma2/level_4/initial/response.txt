explanation: 

The goal is to position the 'baba_obj' to reach the `win_word` at the location `(8, 8)`.  Here is a breakdown of the action sequence:

1. **"down", "down":** Move the 'baba_obj' two steps down to get closer to the 'win_word'.
2. **"left", "left":** Move the 'baba_obj' two steps left to align it with the 'flag_word' at `(8, 1)`.
3. **"down", "down":** Move the 'baba_obj' two steps down to pass the 'flag_word'.
4. **"up", "up":** Move the 'baba_obj' two steps up to align it with the 'win_word' at `(8, 8)`. 
5. **"right", "right":** Move the 'baba_obj' two steps right to reach the 'win_word' and win the level.
