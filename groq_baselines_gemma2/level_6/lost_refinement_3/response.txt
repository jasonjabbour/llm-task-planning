```Python
["left", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "up", "right", "down", "right", "left", "right"] 
```

explanation:

The issue with previous attempts appears to be going too far to the right. The goal is to manipulate 'baba_obj' to line up with and push the 'rock_obj' into the designated space to win. By incorporating more left actions, we can guide 'baba_obj' back towards the center and then push the 'rock_obj' into the 'flag_obj' space.
