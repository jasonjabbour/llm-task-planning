```Python
["right", "right", "down", "down", "right", "down", "right", "right", "down", "down"]
```

Explanation:

This sequence of actions is designed to move the 'baba_obj' character across the game board to reach the 'win_word' location. Here's a breakdown:

1. **"right":**  Move the 'baba_obj' one position to the right.
2. **"right":** Move the 'baba_obj' another position to the right.

Now the baba is at position [4, 2]

3. **"down":** Move the 'baba_obj' down one position.
4. **"down":** Move the 'baba_obj' down one more position. 

Now the baba is at position [4, 0]

5. **"right":** Move the 'baba_obj' right one position.
6. **"down":** Move to the [5, 0]
7. **"right":** Move to [6, 0]
8. **"right":** Move to [7, 0]
9. **"down":** Move to [7, 1]
10. **"down":** Move to [7, 2]

Reaching with the `'baba_obj'` to the `'win_word'`  should trigger the win condition in the game.
