```python
["right", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "up", "right", "down", "right", "down", "left", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "left"] 
```

explanation: 

Based on the provided histories, it seems like the previous attempts struggled to navigate the level efficiently. This new sequence focuses on:

* **Direct Movement:** Prioritizing straight paths towards the goal ("flag_obj").  
* **Strategic Turns:**  Using right and left turns to explore opportunities and avoid getting stuck.
* **Vertical Advancement:**  The "down" actions are used to try and move closer to the flag's location. 

I've also included a few additional "right" and "up" actions to explore possible branching paths and see if I can find a more direct route to the flag. The constant movement and readjustment will hopefully help me avoid repeating past mistakes and find a successful path to win the level.
