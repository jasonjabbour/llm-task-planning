```python
["down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "up", "up"]
```

explanation: 

The previous attempts failed because they either got stuck in a loop or moved the "baba_obj" into the "goop_obj". This sequence focuses on strategically navigating "baba_obj" around the "goop_obj" while making sure to avoid the "sink_word". 

The goal is to reach the "flag_word" by carefully moving "baba_obj" downwards and across the level. The final "up", "up" sequence allows the player to reach the flag.
