```Python
["down", "right", "right", "down", "down", "down", "right", "up"]
```

**Explanation:** 

The goal is to win the level, which means we need to move the controllable object (either 'flag_obj' or 'love_obj').  

* **Starting Point:** The 'flag_obj' is located at [7, 6]. 
* **Winning Condition:** The 'win_word' is located at [3, 8] and [3, 1].

Let's break down the actions:

1. **down:** Move the 'flag_obj' one step down to [8, 6].
2. **right:** Move the 'flag_obj' one step right to [9, 6].
3. **right:** Move the 'flag_obj' one step right to [10, 6].
4. **down:** Move the 'flag_obj' one step down to [10, 7].
5. **down:** Move the 'flag_obj' one step down to [10, 8].
6. **right:** Move the 'flag_obj' one step right to [11, 8].
7. **up:** Move the 'flag_obj' one step up to [11, 7].

By following these actions, we'll successfully move the 'flag_obj' to the 'win_word' location, triggering a win condition.
