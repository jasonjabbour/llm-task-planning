```python
["down", "right", "right", "down", "right", "down", "up"] 
```

explanation: 

Observing the states the replay buffer after each sequence did not show successful completion. 
This new sequence pushes the 'flag_obj' towards the 'win_word' while avoiding obstacles. Its key elements are:

1. **Initial Down:** Moves the controllable object down to a space closer to the win location.

2. **Diagonal Approach:**  Using 'right' and 'down' in sequence allows navigation towards the win area along a commonly available diagonal path. 

3. **Careful Navigation:** 'up' at the end brings the object past 'love_word' and sets it up to potentially interact with the win location.
