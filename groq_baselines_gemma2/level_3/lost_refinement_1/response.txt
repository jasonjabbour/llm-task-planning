```python
["right", "down", "right", "down", "up", "left", "down","left"]
```

explanation:

The previous sequence got stuck in a loop around the love object.  The corrected sequence addresses this by first moving right towards the flag object. Then it proceeds down to align with the win condition. Subsequent movements carefully maneuver around the obstacles to reach the win point.

**Key improvements:**

* **Direct route:** The sequence prioritizes a direct path towards the win condition, avoiding unnecessary meandering. 
* **Obstacle avoidance:** Actions are chosen to navigate around the fixed objects ("love_obj" and "flag_obj") without getting trapped.
