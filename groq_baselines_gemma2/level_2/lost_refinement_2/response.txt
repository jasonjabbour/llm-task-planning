```python
["up", "up", "right", "right", "down"] 
```

explanation: 

The goal of the game is likely to reach the `win_word` location, which is at (2, 4).  

The previous attempts lacked the consistent upward movement needed to reach this goal.  

Here's why this new sequence works:

1. **Two "up" actions:** These ensure you move sufficiently upwards to approach the target location.
2. **Two "right" actions:** These move you horizontally to the rightmost position necessary to reach (2, 4).
3. **One "down" action:** This final move positions the 'baba_obj' on the winning tile. 

This sequence prioritizes vertical movement to reach the correct horizontal position before moving down to claim victory.
