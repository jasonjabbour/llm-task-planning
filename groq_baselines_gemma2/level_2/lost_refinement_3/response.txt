```python
["up", "right", "right", "down", "left", "up"]
```

explanation: 

The agent needs to move the 'baba_obj' to specific locations to win.  Observing the replay buffers from previous attempts,  the agent likely got stuck in a cycle or didn't reach the target location.

Here's a breakdown of the new action sequence and the reasoning:

1. **"up"**: Move the 'baba_obj' upwards to align it with the goal location.
2. **"right", "right"**: Move the 'baba_obj' two spaces to the right to completely reach the "win_word" location.
3. **"down"**: Move the 'baba_obj' one space down, ensuring it overtakes the "you_word" 
4. **"left"**: Move the 'baba_obj' one space left to ensure it's positioned correctly.
5. **"up"**: Move the 'baba_obj' one space up to secure the win.



This sequence focuses on precise movements toward the winning condition, avoiding the patterns that led to failure in previous attempts.
