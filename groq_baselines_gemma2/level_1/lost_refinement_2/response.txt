```python
    ["down", "right", "down", "down", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "down", "left", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "down", "right"]
```

explanation: 

The previous attempts failed because they either got stuck in a loop or did not consider the optimal path to collect the flag and win.

The corrected action sequence takes the following steps:

1. **Move down:** To access the lower path.
2. **Move right:** To get to the section where the flag is located.
3. **Move down twice:** To reach the flag.
4. **Move right:**  To move past the flag.
5. **Move up thrice:** To go up to the winning position.
6.  **Move right twice:** To move across to the winning square.
7.  **Move up:** To reach the winning square.
8. **Move down:** To get below the winning square.
9.  **Move right:** To get to the last square in the winning path.



Let me know if you need me to elaborate further on any step of the logic behind this sequence!
