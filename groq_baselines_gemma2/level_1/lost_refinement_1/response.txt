```python
["right", "down", "left", "up", "right"] 
```

**Explanation:**

The previous sequence seemed to be stuck in a loop, repeatedly moving up and right.  This new sequence aims to break that loop and head directly towards the "win" state.

* **right**:  Move the baba_obj right to get closer to  the flag_word.
* **down**:  Move down to reach the flag_word.
* **left**: Move back left to avoid getting blocked by the "border".
* **up**: Move up  to reach the "win_word".
* **right**: Finally, move right to complete the win condition.



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific action in the sequence or if you have any more context about the game level!
