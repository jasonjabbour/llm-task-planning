```python
["up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "down", "down", "down", "down", "left", "left", "left"]
```

**Explanation:**

The goal in this game is likely to reach the "win_word" location at (8, 8). 

Here's the breakdown of the action sequence:

1. **"up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right":** This string of moves takes the controllable object ('baba_obj') vertically up the board towards the "flag_word" located at (6, 5). 
2. **"up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right":** These are repeated movements to the right, guiding the object towards its destination. 
3. **"down", "down", "down", "down":**  This sequence moves the object down from the "flag_word" towards the "win_word".
4. **"left", "left", "left":** Finally, three movements to the left position the "baba_obj" correctly at the "win_word" .



This action sequence takes the "baba_obj" strategically across the board to reach the designated winning location.
