```python
["down", "left"]
```

explanation: 

The previous attempts failed because they often went in circles or didn't reach the flag object efficiently. 

This new sequence focuses on two key things:

* **Direct path to the flag:** It starts with moving down to get closer to the flag object and then immediately moves left to position the "baba_obj" directly next to it.  

* **Avoiding unnecessary movement:** Unlike past sequences, this one avoids lengthy right-left-right sequences that don't contribute to reaching the flag.
