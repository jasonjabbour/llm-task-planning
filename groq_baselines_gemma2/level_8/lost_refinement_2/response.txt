```python
  ["right", "up", "right"] 
```

**Explanation:**

The previous attempts failed because they didn't directly approach the flag. 

Here's a breakdown of why this new sequence works:

1. **"right":**  Moves the "baba_obj" one space to the right, getting closer to the flag's general location.
2. **"up":** Moves the "baba_obj" one space up, directly placing it into a position to reach the flag.
3. **"right":**  Moves the "baba_obj" one space to the right, onto the flag and causing the player to win.
