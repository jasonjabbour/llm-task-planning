["right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "right"]
```

explanation: The key to winning this level is to navigate the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj' which is located at [5, 8].  Based on previous attempts, we can see these common issues:

* **Getting stuck:**  Previous actions often tried moving up and down too early, potentially leading to getting trapped.
* **Incorrect pathing:** The pathing wasn't consistently leading to the flag object. 

This corrected sequence focuses on:

1. **Moving right:** We need to move the 'baba_obj' horizontally to reach the general area of the flag.
2. **Controlled upward movement:**  We make multiple upward moves to reach the final position above the flag. 
3. **Direct approach:** The sequence avoids unnecessary backtracking and directly aims for the flag's location.
