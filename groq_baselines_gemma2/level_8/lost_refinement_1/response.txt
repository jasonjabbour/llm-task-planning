```python
["down", "down", "right", "right", "up", "up", "left", "left"]
```

**explanation:** 

The previous attempt got stuck in a loop.  It's important to prioritize moving towards the 'flag_obj'. 

1. **Down, Down:** Start by moving down to clear the path below the 'baba_obj'. 
2. **Right, Right:** Move right to align with the 'flag_obj' path.
3. **Up, Up:** Move up to reach the 'flag_obj'.
4. **Left, Left:**  Finally, move left to pick up the flag and win the level.
