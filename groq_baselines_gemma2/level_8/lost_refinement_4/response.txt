```python
["up", "up", "right", "right", "up", "right"]
```

**Explanation:**

Looking at the replay buffer data from the previous attempts, we notice a common issue. Each sequence gets stuck on the wall, unable to proceed. Several actions were taken to maneuver the 'baba_obj', but they didn't lead to success. 

This new sequence starts with "up" to move the 'baba_obj' away from an immediate wall obstacle. Then, it follows with two "right" moves to explore the surrounding area. Finally, another "up" and "right" combination ensures that the 'baba_obj' continues its exploration while avoiding potential wall collisions.


The key is to prioritize moving upward and bypassing the walls to reach the target area where the flag is located. This sequence aims to achieve that by strategically navigating away from blockers.
