```python
["down", "down", "right", "right", "down", "down"]
```

explanation:

The goal in this level seems to be navigating the "baba_obj"  to stand on the "flag_obj". 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **"down", "down":**  The "baba_obj" starts at position [5, 4]. Moving down twice will bring it to position [5, 2].
2. **"right", "right":** Moving right twice from [5, 2] will take it to [7, 2].
3. **"down", "down":** Finally, moving down twice from [7, 2] will bring the "baba_obj" to [7, 0], which is directly next to the "flag_obj" at [4, 8]. 



Let me know if you'd like me to analyze a different state or level!
