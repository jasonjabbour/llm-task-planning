```Python
["right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "up"] 
```

explanation: 

The goal of the game is to reach the 'win_word' which is located at (8, 1). 

* Previous attempts failed because they either got stuck in lava or moved into an unreachable area.
*  This sequence directs the 'baba_obj' systematically towards the 'win_word', avoiding the 'lava_obj' and exploiting the layout of the 'empty' spaces.  



Let me know if you want to test this sequence!  I can help you simulate it based on the provided state and action space.
