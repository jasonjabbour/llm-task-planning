```python
["right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "up"] 
```

explanation: 

The previous action sequences all failed because they led the 'baba_obj' into the lava. This corrected sequence aims to navigate the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj' while avoiding the lava:

* **"right", "down"**: Move the 'baba_obj' one step right, then one step down to clear the immediate lava.
* **Repeated "right", "down"**:  Continue moving the 'baba_obj' diagonally right-downward until it reaches the 'flag_obj'. 
* **"right", "up"**: Finally, move the 'baba_obj' right one step to be directly next to the 'flag_obj', then up to trigger the win condition.
