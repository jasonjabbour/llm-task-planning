```python
["right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "wrong_action"] 
```

explanation: 

Looking at the past attempts and replay buffers, it seems like the core issue is navigating the baba_obj to the bottom right corner to touch the "win_word" . 

Here's why the proposed sequence is corrected:

- **"right"**: Moves the baba_obj one space to the right to approach the "win_word."

- **"down"**: Moves the baba_obj one space down, getting closer to the target location.

- **"right", "down", "right", "down"**: These repeated movements continue guiding the baba_obj straight down towards the bottom right corner.

- **"wrong_action"**: This placeholder indicates that based on the game's rules and level layout, there likely shouldn't be a need for any input  beyond navigating to the "win_word". You'll need to adjust this based on observations from the game itself.

**Improvements:**

- **Careful Observation:**  The  `'win_word'` location should be observed closely to confirm the exact number of  `right` and `down` movements required.


Remember to always analyze the state changes after each action in the replay buffer to understand the game's mechanics and refine your approach.
