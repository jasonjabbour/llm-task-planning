```python
["right", "right", "down", "down", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "up", "up", "left", "left"]
```

**explanation:**

The goal of this level seems to be to move the character represented by `you_word` to the `win_word` position.  Here's the breakdown of the action sequence:

1. **`right`, `right`, `down`, `down`**: Move the character two steps to the right, then two steps down to reach the `baba_word` position.
2. **`right`, `right`**: Move two steps to the right to reach `flag_obj`.
3. **`up`, `up`, `up`**: Move three steps up to reach `flag_word`.
4. **`right`, `right`**: Move two steps to the right to reach the `win_word` position.
5. **`up`, `up`**: Move two steps up to obtain the win. 

   This sequence navigates the character strategically through the level, avoiding obstacles and reaching the target.
