```python
["right", "down", "down", "right", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "down", "right"]
```

explanation: The previous attempt got stuck in a loop moving right and down. This new sequence aims to navigate the baba more strategically. 

* It moves right initially to access new areas. 
* Then, it carefully moves down to avoid barriers and reach the goal. 
* Finally, it moves right again to get to the winning position. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific move!
