Analysis of Previous Attempts:

*  Both previous attempts led the 'baba_obj' too far to the right, getting stuck near the wall_word.  

*  The issue is reaching the win_word.  

Corrected Approach:

1. **right**: Move 'baba_obj' one space to the right.
2. **down**: Move 'baba_obj' down to clear the path towards the win_word.
3. **right**: Move towards the win_word.
4. **right**: Move one more space towards the win_word.
5. **down**:  Move down to reach the  'won' flag_obj. 
6. **right**: Attempt to go downwards while avoiding walls
7. **up**: Move 'baba_obj' upwards, using u_d sequence.
8. **up**: Continue moving upwards to further position 'baba_obj'.
9. **right**: Move 'baba_obj' to reach the win_word.
