```python
["right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "up", "up", "right", "right", "down", "right"] 
```
explanation: 

Based on the previous attempts and the replay buffer information, it seems like the agent is stuck in a loop or making inefficient movements.  The new sequence focuses on:

1. **Progressing rightward:** The character needs to move horizontally towards the 'win_word'.  
2. **Descending carefully:**  There are 'wall' and 'stop' obstacles, so carefully descending is crucial to avoid those.


This sequence aims to  guide the 'baba_obj' towards the 'win_word'  while navigating the obstacles effectively.
