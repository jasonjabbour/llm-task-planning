```python
["down", "right", "down", "right"]
```

explanation: 

The goal is to get the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj'. Examining the initial state, the 'baba_obj' is at (2,6) and the 'flag_obj' is at (7,7).  It seems the previous attempts failed because they led to the 'baba_obj' moving into goop. This sequence aims to carefully navigate around the goop obstacles.  


        Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on the reasoning behind choosing this specific sequence! I can break down each step and explain how it avoids pitfalls based on the replay buffer.
