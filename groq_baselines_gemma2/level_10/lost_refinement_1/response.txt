```python
["up", "right", "right", "up"]
```

**Explanation:**

The previous strategy encountered a loss by moving the 'baba_obj' into the 'goop_obj' space. This new sequence attempts to:

1. **Move 'up' to avoid the goop:** This initial action tries to put some distance between Baba and the goop.
2. **Move 'right' twice:** This aims to get Baba closer to the 'flag_word' while still being careful not to fall into any goop.
3. **Move 'up' again:** This final upward movement is a safety precaution to ensure Baba doesn't accidentally step on any goop while approaching the flag.  

The goal is to navigate Baba to the 'win_word' safely without triggering a loss condition.
