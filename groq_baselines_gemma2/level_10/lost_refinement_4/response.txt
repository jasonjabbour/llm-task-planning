```python
["up", "left", "down"]
```

explanation: This sequence aims to strategically avoid the goop obstacles and reach the desired location. 

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

* **Previous Attempts:** Examining the history reveals that my previous attempts often led to hitting "goop_obj" and triggering a "lost" state. This indicates a need to carefully navigate around those obstacles.
* **Object Positioning:** The current state shows the "flag_word" is slightly to the left and above the "you_word".  The path  "up", "left", "down" should guide the controllable "baba_obj" to the flag word.
