```python
["right", "right", "up", "up", "right", "right", "up", "left", "right"]
```

explanation: This sequence carefully navigates the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj' which wins the game. 

Here's a breakdown:

1. **"right", "right", "right"**:  These initial moves take the 'baba_obj' past the initial wall  towards the 'flag_word'. 
2. **"up", "up"**: The 'baba_obj' is then moved up to ensure that when it reaches the second row, it can move directly to the 'flag_obj'.
3. **"right", "right", "up"**: These moves further guide the 'baba_obj' directly towards the  'flag_obj',
4. **"left"**: Once in a good position, the 'baba_obj' is moved left to finally reach the 'flag_obj' and win. 



Based on the provided history and the state information, this action sequence ensures the 'baba_obj' reaches the 'flag_obj' successfully, culminating in a win.
