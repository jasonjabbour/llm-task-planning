```python
['right','up','right','up','right','up','left','left','left'] 
```

explanation: 
The goal is to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj' to win.  In my previous attempts I was trying to maneuver 'baba_obj' to the right faster, but I need to carefully position it above the 'flag_obj' before moving left.
 This sequence of actions should allow me to  reach the  'flag_obj'.
