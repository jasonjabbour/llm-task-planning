```Python
["right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "left", "left", "left"]
```

**explanation:**

The goal of this level appears to be reaching the 'win_word' location at (8, 8).  Analysis of the state shows:

1. **'baba_obj' is controllable:** This object will likely be used to reach the 'win_word'.

2. **Proximity to 'win_word':** The 'baba_obj' is initially at (2, 4) which is a few steps away from the 'win_word'.

**Action Sequence:**

* **"right", "right", "right":** Move the 'baba_obj' three positions to the right, positioning it directly below the 'win_word'.
* **"up", "up", "up":** Move the 'baba_obj' three positions up, aligning it with the 'win_word'.
* **"left", "left", "left":**  Move the 'baba_obj' three positions left to land on the 'win_word', achieving victory.
