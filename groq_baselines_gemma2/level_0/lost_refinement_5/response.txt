```python
["right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "left", "up", "right"]
```

explanation: 
This sequence of actions aims to strategically maneuver the `baba_obj` to the winning position. 

-  The initial `right` movements shift the `baba_obj` horizontally towards the `flag_obj`. 
-  The subsequent `up` movements carefully navigate it upwards while avoiding obstacles.
-  Finally, a `left` movement corrects the position before a series of `up` movements concludes the path to the `win_word`.
