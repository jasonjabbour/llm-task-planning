```python
["left", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "left", "up"]
```

explanation:

The previous attempts mostly focused on moving the 'baba_obj' horizontally, but it seems the key is manipulating the 'rock_obj' to create a path to the flag. 

This sequence:

1. **left, down:** Moves the 'baba_obj' to allow the rock to potentially slide down. 
2. **right, down:** Shifts 'baba_obj' again, guiding the rock further.
3. **right, down:** Continues guiding the 'rock_obj' downwards.
4. **left, up:** This is crucial! It retreats the 'baba_obj' to avoid blocking the path to the flag and allows 'you_word' to reach the flag.
