```python
["left", "down", "left", "down"] 
```

explanation: 

The previous sequence tried moving the "baba_obj" right, which led to it being stuck.  The corrected sequence aims to:

1. **`left`**: Move baba_obj  left to access the `flag_word`
2. **`down`**:  Move baba_obj down to reach the `flag_word` and interact with it.
3. **`left`**: Move baba_obj left to access the win condition.
4. **`down`**: Move baba_obj down to collect the `win_word` and win the level.
