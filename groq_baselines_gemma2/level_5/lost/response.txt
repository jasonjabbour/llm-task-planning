```python
["down", "right", "down", "right"] 
```

## Explanation:

The goal is to win the level, meaning to reach the `win_word` location.  The current state shows the `win_word` at '[8, 8]' and the controllable character 'baba_obj' at [2,5]. 

This sequence of actions will move the 'baba_obj' to the winning position:

* **down:** Moves the 'baba_obj' one step down.
* **right:** Moves the 'baba_obj' one step right.
* **down:** Moves the 'baba_obj' one step down.
* **right:** Moves the 'baba_obj' one step right, reaching the `win_word` position [8,8].
