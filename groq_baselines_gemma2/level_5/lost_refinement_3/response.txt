```Python
["right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down"]
```

### Explanation:
My previous attempts failed to reliably get the baba object into position to progress.  

This new sequence focuses on:

* **Moving the `baba_obj` object to the right**: Using a series of "right" moves will push the `baba_obj` towards the desired position near the `flag_word`.
* **Vertical Movement**:  The "down" moves are strategic. They aim to manipulate the `baba_obj`'s position relative to the `rock_word` and any potential obstacles.


By repeatedly moving right and then down, the plan  is to guide the `baba_obj`  through the level, avoiding obstacles and ultimately reaching the flag.
