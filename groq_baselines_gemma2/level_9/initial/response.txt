```python
["down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right"] 
```

explanation:

The goal in this level appears to be reaching and interacting with the 'win_word' located at (8, 1).  The player controlled object 'baba_obj' is currently at (2, 5). The optimal path involves constantly moving down and right to navigate towards the 'win_word'. This strategy will require careful circumvention of any obstacles in its path, demonstrated by the repetitive sequence of "down" and "right" actions.
