```python
["up", "up", "right", "right", "down", "right"]
```

explanation: 

The previous sequence kept moving the 'baba_obj' horizontally, which didn't lead to progress.  This new sequence first moves the 'baba_obj' upwards, potentially to access a higher area with necessary elements to win. Then it moves right to navigate horizontally,  and finally down to likely reach the flag or interact with key objects. 

This sequence utilizes a more vertical approach, exploring different levels instead of being solely focused on horizontal movement. This could be more effective in reaching the win condition.
