```Python
["down", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "up", "left", "up", "up", "up"]
```

**Explanation:**

In the previous attempt, the sequence resulted in losing the game because moving left from position `[2,6]` led Baba into a `goop_obj` at `[1,6]`, which caused Baba to sink and the game to be lost due to the rule **GOOP IS SINK**.

To correct this, we avoid moving left into the goop. Instead, we guide Baba to use the rocks to clear a path through the goop towards the flag.

**Step-by-step Actions and Reasons:**

1. **Move Down x4** (`"down", "down", "down", "down"`)
   - Moves Baba from `[2,6]` to `[2,2]`, reaching the bottom row where there is an open path.
   
2. **Move Right x3** (`"right", "right", "right"`)
   - Positions Baba at `[5,2]`, approaching the rocks.
   
3. **Move Up** (`"up"`)
   - Moves Baba to `[5,3]`, adjacent to a rock at `[7,3]`.
   
4. **Move Left** (`"left"`)
   - Positions Baba at `[4,3]`, preparing to push the rock.
   
5. **Move Up x3** (`"up", "up", "up"`)
   - Pushes the rock upwards through the goop at `[4,4]`, `[4,5]`, and `[4,6]`, destroying the goop due to **GOOP IS SINK** and creating a path.
   
By using the rock to sink the goop, Baba can now safely reach the flag at `[7,7]` without sinking. Since **FLAG IS WIN** is an active rule, touching the flag results in winning the level.

**Why This Action Sequence Works:**

- **Avoids Hazardous Goop:** By not moving left into the goop at `[1,6]`, Baba avoids sinking.
- **Utilizes Rocks Strategically:** The rocks are pushed into the goop to remove it, leveraging the **GOOP IS SINK** rule to clear a path.
- **Reaches the Goal:** This path allows Baba to approach the flag directly and win the game by touching it under the active **FLAG IS WIN** rule.

**Conclusion:**

This corrected action sequence navigates around the previous pitfalls, utilizes game mechanics effectively, and leads to winning the level.
