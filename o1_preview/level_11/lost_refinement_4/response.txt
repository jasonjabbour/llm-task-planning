```Python
["down", "down", "down", "down", "left", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Breaking the "Goop is Sink" Rule:**
   - The initial sequence `["down", "down", "down", "down", "left"]` moves Baba from position `[2, 6]` to `[1, 2]`, where the `is_word` is located.
   - Performing `["right"]` at `[1, 2]` pushes the `is_word` from `[1, 2]` to `[2, 2]`.
   - This disrupts the "Goop is Sink" rule (`["goop_word" at [1, 3], "is_word" at [1, 2], "sink_word" at [1, 1]]`), as the `is_word` is no longer aligned with `goop_word` and `sink_word`.
   - With the "Goop is Sink" rule broken, Goop no longer destroys Baba upon contact.

2. **Reaching the Flag:**
   - From position `[1, 2]`, Baba proceeds to move towards the flag at `[7, 7]`.
   - The sequence `["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]` moves Baba horizontally from `[1, 2]` to `[7, 2]`.
   - The positions `[2, 2]` to `[7, 2]` are empty, allowing unobstructed movement.
   - Next, the sequence `["up", "up", "up", "up", "up"]` moves Baba vertically from `[7, 2]` to `[7, 7]`.
   - Baba traverses through positions that may contain Goop, but since the "Goop is Sink" rule is broken, Baba can safely pass through them.

3. **Winning the Level:**
   - Upon reaching `[7, 7]`, where the `flag_obj` is located, Baba wins the game as per the "Flag is Win" rule (`["flag_word" at [1, 7], "is_word" at [2, 7], "win_word" at [3, 7]]`).

**Why This Works Now:**

- **Previous Attempts Failed** because Baba couldn't reach the flag without being destroyed by Goop due to the active "Goop is Sink" rule.
- **This Action Sequence Succeeds** by:
  - **Disabling the Hazard:** Breaking the "Goop is Sink" rule removes the sinking hazard.
  - **Direct Path to Goal:** Baba takes a path with minimal obstacles to the flag.
- **Result:** Baba reaches the flag without being destroyed, fulfilling the win condition.
