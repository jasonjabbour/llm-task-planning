**Explanation:**

To win the level, we need to move Baba (our controllable character) to the flag at position `[7, 7]` without sinking into the goop, which is currently set to "sink" objects that touch it (`GOOP IS SINK`). Since the path to the flag is blocked by goop, we'll use the rocks (`ROCK IS PUSH`) to clear a path through the goop by sinking the rocks into it.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the action sequence:

1. **Move Down x4:**  
   Navigate Baba down from `[2, 6]` to `[2, 2]` to reach the bottom row, avoiding goop obstacles on the right.

2. **Move Right x4:**  
   Move Baba right from `[2, 2]` to `[6, 2]` along the bottom row, approaching the area where the rocks are located.

3. **Move Up:**  
   Go up to `[6, 3]`, preparing to interact with the first rock.

4. **Move Right:**  
   Move right to `[7, 3]`, where the first rock is located.

5. **Push First Rock Up:**  
   Push the rock up into the goop at `[7, 4]`. This action sinks both the rock and the goop at that position, clearing the space.

6. **Move Down and Around to Second Rock:**  
   - Move down to `[7, 3]` (we are already here after pushing the rock).
   - Move down again to `[7, 2]`.
   - Move right to `[8, 2]`.

7. **Push Second Rock Left:**  
   - Move up to `[8, 3]`, where the second rock is.
   - Push the second rock left to `[7, 3]`.

8. **Push Second Rock Up Twice:**  
   - Move down to `[7, 2]`.
   - Move up to `[7, 3]`.
   - Push the second rock up to `[7, 4]` (now clear after sinking the first rock and goop).
   - Push the rock up again to `[7, 5]`, sinking it into the next goop tile and clearing more of the path.

9. **Move Up to the Flag:**  
   - Move up from `[7, 4]` to `[7, 5]` (now empty).
   - Continue moving up through `[7, 6]`.
   - Reach `[7, 7]`, where the flag is located.

By using the rocks to eliminate the goop tiles at `[7, 4]` and `[7, 5]`, we've safely created a path for Baba to reach the flag without sinking. Touching the flag, which is set to "win" (`FLAG IS WIN`), completes the level.
