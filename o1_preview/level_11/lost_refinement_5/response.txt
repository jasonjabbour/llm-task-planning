```Python

["down", "down", "down", "down", "left", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up"]

```

Explanation:

In this action sequence, the first five moves (four 'down' and one 'left') lead Baba to push the 'is' word out of the 'GOOP IS SINK' vertical rule at positions (1,3), (1,2), and (1,1). This breaks the 'GOOP IS SINK' rule, removing the 'sink' property from the 'goop' objects. 

After breaking the rule, Baba moves back to the starting position with one 'right' and four 'up' moves. Now that the 'goop' objects no longer have the 'sink' property, Baba can safely walk over them. Baba then moves 'right' four times, stepping over the 'goop' objects without sinking. Finally, by moving 'up', Baba reaches the 'flag' object at position (7,7). Since 'FLAG IS WIN' is already established in the level, touching the flag wins the game.

This action sequence is correct because it allows Baba to reach the flag by disabling the dangerous 'sink' property of the 'goop' objects, clearing a safe path to the win condition.
