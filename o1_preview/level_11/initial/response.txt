```Python
["down", "down", "down", "down", "left", "up", "up", "up", "up", "left", "up", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Move Down 4 times**: Starting from position `[2,6]`, we move down to reach position `[2,2]` just next to the `'IS'` word at `[1,2]`. This sequence of moves is `["down", "down", "down", "down"]`.

2. **Push 'IS' Right**: At position `[2,2]`, we face left and move left to push the `'IS'` word from `[1,2]` to `[2,2]`. This breaks the rule `'GOOP IS SINK'` because the words are no longer aligned. The action here is `["left"]`.

3. **Move Up 4 times**: We move back up to our original horizontal level at position `[2,6]`. This sequence is `["up", "up", "up", "up"]`.

4. **Move Left into 'GOOP'**: We move left into position `[1,6]`, which has a `'GOOP'` object. Since `'GOOP IS SINK'` is broken, the goop no longer sinks us, and we can pass through. The action is `["left"]`.

5. **Move Up**: We move up to position `[1,7]`. The action is `["up"]`.

6. **Move Right 6 times**: From `[1,7]`, we move right through positions `[2,7]` to `[7,7]`. Along the way, we pass over any `'GOOP'` objects without sinking. This sequence is `["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]`.

7. **Reach the 'FLAG'**: At position `[7,7]`, we touch the `'FLAG'` object. Since the rule `'FLAG IS WIN'` is still in effect, touching the flag causes us to win the level.

By breaking the `'GOOP IS SINK'` rule and navigating through the goop, we create a direct path to the flag and win the game.
