```Python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]
```

**Explanation:**

In the given level, we start with:

- **Baba** (the controllable character) at position **[2, 4]**.
- A **flag** (the winning object) at position **[7, 4]**.
- The rules **"BABA IS YOU"** and **"FLAG IS WIN"** are already in effect, formed by the words on the top row.

Our goal is to move Baba to the position of the flag to win the level. Since there are no obstacles (like walls or borders) between Baba and the flag along the row **y = 4**, we can simply move Baba to the right to reach the flag.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **First Move ("right")**:
   - Baba moves from **[2, 4]** to **[3, 4]**.

2. **Second Move ("right")**:
   - Baba moves from **[3, 4]** to **[4, 4]**.

3. **Third Move ("right")**:
   - Baba moves from **[4, 4]** to **[5, 4]**.

4. **Fourth Move ("right")**:
   - Baba moves from **[5, 4]** to **[6, 4]**.

5. **Fifth Move ("right")**:
   - Baba moves from **[6, 4]** to **[7, 4]**, the position of the flag.

At the end of these moves, Baba occupies the same position as the flag. With the rule **"FLAG IS WIN"** active, touching the flag causes the game to be won.

**Why this works:**

- The path from Baba to the flag is clearâ€”there are no obstacles like walls between them.
- Moving right five times is the most direct route.
- The rules **"BABA IS YOU"** ensure we control Baba, and **"FLAG IS WIN"** means touching the flag wins the level.

Therefore, executing the action sequence `["right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]` will result in winning the level.
