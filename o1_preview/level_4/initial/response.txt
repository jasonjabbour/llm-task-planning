Explanation:

Starting from the initial state, our goal is to win the level by manipulating the game rules and reaching a winning condition. Since there is no 'flag_obj' on the map, but we have a 'rock_obj' at position [7, 5], we'll aim to change the rules to make 'rock' the winning object by forming the sentence "ROCK IS WIN". Hereâ€™s how the action sequence achieves this:

1. **Navigate to the 'ROCK' Word**:
   - **Actions**: `"right", "right", "down", "down"`
   - **Reasoning**: Move Baba (our controllable character at [2, 5]) right to [4, 5], then down to [4, 3] to reach the 'rock_word' at [4, 3].

2. **Push 'ROCK' Word Up to Align with 'IS' and 'WIN' Words**:
   - **Actions**: `"left", "up", "up", "up"`
   - **Reasoning**: Move left to position behind the 'rock_word', then push it upward from [4, 3] to [4, 6].

3. **Align 'ROCK', 'IS', and 'WIN' Words Horizontally**:
   - **Actions**: `"right", "right", "right"`
   - **Reasoning**: Push the 'rock_word' right from [4, 6] to [7, 6], aligning it with an 'is_word' and 'win_word' to form "ROCK IS WIN".

4. **Adjust 'IS' and 'WIN' Words if Necessary**:
   - **Actions**: `"down", "left", "down", "down"`
   - **Reasoning**: If 'is_word' and 'win_word' are not aligned, push them down or sideways to complete the sentence.

5. **Reach the 'ROCK' Object**:
   - **Actions**: `"left", "up", "down"`
   - **Reasoning**: Navigate to the 'rock_obj' at [7, 5]. Since "ROCK IS WIN" is active, touching the rock will win the level.

By executing these actions, we manipulate the words to change the game rules, making the rock the winning object. Finally, we reach the rock to win the level. This strategy leverages the mechanics of the game, allowing us to overcome the initial absence of a win condition by creating one ourselves.
