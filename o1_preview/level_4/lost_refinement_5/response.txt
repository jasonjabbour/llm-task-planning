### Explanation:

To win the level, we need to change the rules to make `BABA IS WIN` while keeping `BABA IS YOU` intact so that we retain control over Baba when the win condition is satisfied.

Here's how the action sequence achieves this:

1. **Move right twice**: 
   - Move from `[2,5]` to `[4,5]`.
   - This positions Baba to move upwards without obstructing other important tiles.

2. **Move up three times**: 
   - Move from `[4,5]` to `[4,8]`.
   - At `[4,8]`, Baba is below the empty space next to `BABA IS YOU`.

3. **Move left**:
   - Move from `[4,8]` to `[3,8]`.
   - Baba is now underneath the `YOU` word at `[3,8]`.

4. **Move down three times**:
   - Push the `YOU` word down from `[3,8]` to `[3,5]`.
   - This temporarily breaks `BABA IS YOU`, but we'll fix it shortly.

5. **Move left**:
   - Move from `[3,5]` to `[2,5]`.
   - Baba is back to the starting column, ready to reposition the `IS` word.

6. **Move down three times**:
   - Move from `[2,5]` to `[2,2]`.
   - Position Baba next to the `IS` word at `[2,8]` when we move back up.

7. **Move right twice**:
   - Move from `[2,2]` to `[4,2]`.
   - Prepare to push the `WIN` word.

8. **Move up three times**:
   - Push the `WIN` word up from `[4,2]` to `[4,5]`.
   - The `WIN` word is now in line to form `BABA IS WIN`.

At this point, we have rearranged the words to read:

```
BABA IS WIN
     IS YOU
```

By re-establishing `BABA IS YOU` vertically and creating `BABA IS WIN` horizontally, we satisfy the win condition while retaining control over Baba.

**Why this works:**

- **Maintains Control**: By ensuring `BABA IS YOU` remains intact after moving the words, we keep control of Baba.
- **Satisfies Win Condition**: Forming `BABA IS WIN` declares Baba as the winning object.
- **Avoids Previous Mistakes**: Unlike previous attempts where pushing words broke essential rules or led to dead-ends, this sequence carefully preserves necessary rules and achieves the objective.

### Summary:

This action sequence strategically moves Baba to rearrange the words on the board, creating the necessary conditions to win the level without losing control of Baba.
