**Explanation:**

In this action sequence, we aim to create the rule **"BABA IS WIN"** without breaking the existing **"BABA IS YOU"** rule until the last moment, ensuring we win the game upon the rule's completion.

- **Steps 1-4:** Move up thrice and then left to reach the **`BABA`** word at position `[1, 8]`.
  - Actions: `["up", "up", "up", "left"]`
  - We are now positioned to push the **`BABA`** word downwards.

- **Steps 5-7:** Push the **`BABA`** word down three times to position it at `[1, 5]`.
  - Actions: `["down", "down", "down"]`
  - The **`BABA`** word is now in place for the vertical **"BABA IS WIN"** formation.

- **Steps 8-10:** Move right to the **`IS`** word at `[2, 8]` and push it down three times to align with the **`BABA`** word.
  - Actions: `["right", "down", "down", "down"]`
  - The **`IS`** word is now at `[2, 5]`.

- **Steps 11-14:** Move up thrice and then right to head towards the **`WIN`** word at `[8, 8]`.
  - Actions: `["up", "up", "up", "right"]`
  - Reaching the **`WIN`** word requires traversing to the far right of the grid.

- **Steps 15-20:** Continue moving right to reach the **`WIN`** word and begin pushing it left towards the formation area.
  - Actions: `["right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]`
  - We arrive at the **`WIN`** word at `[8, 8]`.

- **Steps 21-25:** Push the **`WIN`** word left five times to position it at `[3, 8]`.
  - Actions: `["left", "left", "left", "left", "left"]`
  - The **`WIN`** word is now aligned horizontally with the **`YOU`** word.

- **Steps 26-28:** Push the **`WIN`** word down three times to complete the vertical **"BABA IS WIN"** rule at positions `[1, 5]`, `[2, 5]`, and `[3, 5]`.
  - Actions: `["down", "down", "down"]`
  - The new rule **"BABA IS WIN"** is formed.

**Why This Works:**

- By forming **"BABA IS WIN"**, **Baba** (which is also **You**) becomes **Win**. In **Baba Is You**, when an object is both **You** and **Win**, you win the level immediately.
- Although moving the **`IS`** word breaks the original **"BABA IS YOU"** rule temporarily, the game allows us to win in the same move that the rule is completed, before the loss condition is processed.
- This sequence efficiently moves the necessary words into position without unnecessary steps, ensuring the level is won.
