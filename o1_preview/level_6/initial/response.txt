```Python
["up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right"]
```

Explanation:

Starting from the initial position of `baba_obj` at [2,2], we need to reach the `flag_obj` at [5,5] to win the level because the rule "FLAG IS WIN" is active. However, there are `rock_obj` obstacles between Baba and the flag. Since the rule "ROCK IS PUSH" is also active, we can push the rocks out of the way.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Move Up**: From [2,2] to [2,3].
2. **Move Right**: From [2,3] to [3,3].
3. **Move Up**: From [3,3] to [3,4].
   - At [3,4], Baba encounters `rock_obj` at [3,4] and [3,5].
   - Since rocks are pushable, moving up pushes both rocks from [3,4] and [3,5] to [3,5] and [3,6], respectively.
4. **Move Right**: From [3,4] to [4,4].
5. **Move Up**: From [4,4] to [4,5].
6. **Move Right**: From [4,5] to [5,5], where the `flag_obj` is located.

By touching the flag at [5,5], we win the level due to the "FLAG IS WIN" rule.

This sequence efficiently navigates Baba to the flag by clearing the obstacles and utilizing the game's mechanics.
