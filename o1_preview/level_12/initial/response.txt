```

**Explanation:**

Starting at the initial position of `baba_obj` at coordinates `[5, 4]`, our goal is to reach the `flag_obj` at `[4, 8]` to win the level. However, there is a `lava_obj` river at `y = 6` that we cannot cross without melting due to the current rule **"BABA IS MELT"** combined with **"LAVA IS HOT"**. To overcome this, we need to break the "BABA IS MELT" rule.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Break "BABA IS MELT" Rule:**
   - **Action:** `up`
     - Move from `[5, 4]` to `[5, 5]`.
   - **Action:** `right`
     - Move from `[5, 5]` to `[6, 5]`.
   - **Action:** `right`
     - Move from `[6, 5]` to `[7, 5]`, pushing the `BABA` word from `[7, 5]` to `[8, 5]`.
   - **Action:** `down`
     - Move from `[7, 5]` to `[7, 4]`.
   - **Action:** `down`
     - Move from `[7, 4]` to `[7, 3]`.
   - **Action:** `left`
     - Move from `[7, 3]` to `[6, 3]`.
   - **Action:** `right`
     - Push the `MELT` word from `[7, 3]` to `[8, 3]`.
     - The "BABA IS MELT" rule is now broken because the `MELT` word is no longer aligned with `BABA IS`.

2. **Cross the Lava River:**
   - **Action:** `up`
     - Move from `[7, 3]` to `[7, 4]`.
   - **Action:** `up`
     - Move from `[7, 4]` to `[7, 5]`.
   - **Action:** `up`
     - Move from `[7, 5]` to `[7, 6]` (crossing over `lava_obj` without melting since "BABA IS MELT" is broken).
   - **Action:** `up`
     - Move from `[7, 6]` to `[7, 7]`.

3. **Reach the Flag:**
   - **Action:** `left`
     - Move from `[7, 7]` to `[6, 7]`.
   - **Action:** `left`
     - Move from `[6, 7]` to `[5, 7]`.
   - **Action:** `up`
     - Move from `[5, 7]` to `[5, 8]`.
   - **Action:** `left`
     - Move from `[5, 8]` to `[4, 8]`, where the `flag_obj` is located.

By following these actions, `baba_obj` successfully reaches the `flag_obj`. Since the rule **"FLAG IS WIN"** is in effect, touching the flag results in winning the level.
