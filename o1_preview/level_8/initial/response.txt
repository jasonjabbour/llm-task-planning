explanation:

We start by controlling 'baba_obj' at position [5,4] with the goal of reaching the 'flag_obj' at position [5,8]. However, there is a horizontal wall at y=6 blocking the direct path upward, and since "WALL IS STOP" is active, we cannot pass through it.

To overcome this obstacle, we need to break the "WALL IS STOP" rule. Here's how the actions achieve this:

1. **Move Left Three Times**: 
   - **First Left**: Move from [5,4] to [4,4].
   - **Second Left**: Move from [4,4] to [3,4].
   - **Third Left**: Move from [3,4] to [2,4], pushing the 'is_word' from [2,4] to [1,4]. This breaks the vertical alignment of "WALL IS STOP" at x=2, thus deactivating the rule.

2. **Move Right Three Times**:
   - **First Right**: Move back to [3,4].
   - **Second Right**: Move to [4,4].
   - **Third Right**: Return to [5,4], our original x-position.

3. **Move Up Four Times**:
   - **First Up**: Move from [5,4] to [5,5].
   - **Second Up**: Move to [5,6], passing through the wall since "WALL IS STOP" is no longer active.
   - **Third Up**: Move to [5,7].
   - **Fourth Up**: Reach [5,8], where the 'flag_obj' is located.

Since "FLAG IS WIN" is active (from the horizontal alignment of 'flag_word' at [6,1], 'is_word' at [7,1], and 'win_word' at [8,1]), touching the flag at [5,8] wins the game.

This sequence effectively breaks the rule preventing us from passing through walls and allows us to reach the goal.
