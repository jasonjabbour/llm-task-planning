Explanation:

To win the level, we need to reach the flag at position `[6, 7]`. However, there is a wall at position `y = 6` that prevents us from moving directly to the flag. The walls are impassable because of the rule **`WALL IS STOP`** formed by the words at positions `[8, 5]` (`wall_word`), `[8, 4]` (`is_word`), and `[8, 3]` (`stop_word`).

Our strategy is to break the **`WALL IS STOP`** rule so that walls are no longer impassable. Here's how the action sequence achieves this:

1. **"right"**: Move `baba_obj` from `[6, 4]` to `[7, 4]`.
2. **"right"**: Move to `[8, 4]`, where `is_word` is located.
3. **"down"**: Push `is_word` down from `[8, 4]` to `[8, 3]`, which pushes `stop_word` from `[8, 3]` to `[8, 2]`. This breaks the **`WALL IS STOP`** sentence.
4. **"left"**: Move back to `[7, 4]`.
5. **"up"**: Move to `[7, 5]`.
6. **"up"**: Move to `[7, 6]`. Since **`WALL IS STOP`** is broken, we can pass through the wall at `[7, 6]`.
7. **"left"**: Move to `[6, 6]`.
8. **"up"**: Move to `[6, 7]`, where the `flag_obj` is located. Since the rule **`FLAG IS WIN`** is in effect, touching the flag here wins the game.

By breaking the **`WALL IS STOP`** rule, we make the walls passable and can reach the flag to win the level.
