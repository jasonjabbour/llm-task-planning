Explanation:

To win the level, we need to reach the flag at position `[6, 7]`. However, a wall blocks the direct path, and since "wall is stop" is in effect, we cannot pass through it. Our goal is to break this rule by moving one of the words forming it.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Move Right to `[7, 4]`**: From our starting position `[6, 4]`, we move right to `[7, 4]`.

2. **Move Down to `[7, 3]`**: This positions us adjacent to the "stop" word at `[8, 3]`.

3. **Push "Stop" Left to `[7, 3]`**: By moving right, we push the "stop" word from `[8, 3]` to `[7, 3]`. This breaks the vertical "wall is stop" rule since the words are no longer aligned.

4. **Move Up to `[7, 4]`**: We move back up to `[7, 4]`.

5. **Move Up to `[7, 5]`**: Continuing upwards, we reach the level of the wall at `[7, 6]`.

6. **Move Up to `[7, 6]`**: Since "wall is stop" has been broken, we can now pass through the wall.

7. **Move Left to `[6, 6]`**: We move left towards the flag's column.

8. **Move Up to `[6, 7]`**: Finally, we reach the flag. Touching it wins the game because "flag is win" is active.

By following these actions, we manipulate the game rules to our advantage and reach the goal to win the level.
