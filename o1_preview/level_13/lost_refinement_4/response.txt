```Python
['up', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'left', 'up', 'left']
```

Explanation:

The above action sequence allows Baba to win the level by reaching the flag. Here's why this sequence works:

1. **Break "Wall is Stop":** By moving `up`, then `right`, and then `right` again, Baba pushes the `wall_word` at position `[8, 5]` to the left. This action disrupts the vertical arrangement of `Wall is Stop` (`wall_word` at `[8, 5]`, `is_word` at `[8, 4]`, `stop_word` at `[8, 3]`), effectively breaking the rule. With "Wall is Stop" no longer in effect, walls are no longer impassable.

2. **Pass Through Walls:** After breaking the rule, Baba moves `up` and then `left`, passing through the walls that were previously blocking the path. Since walls are no longer "Stop," Baba can move through them freely.

3. **Reach the Flag:** Finally, Baba moves `up` and `left` to reach the flag at position `[6, 7]`. Since "Flag is Win" is already established in the level (with `flag_word` at `[6, 1]`, `is_word` at `[7, 1]`, and `win_word` at `[8, 1]`), touching the flag results in winning the game.

This sequence corrects the previous attempts by focusing on disabling the walls that were blocking Baba from reaching the flag, rather than trying to find alternative paths or manipulate other game objects. By directly breaking "Wall is Stop," Baba gains a clear path to victory.
