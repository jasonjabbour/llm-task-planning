**Explanation:**

To win the level, we need to move **Baba** (our controllable `baba_obj` at position `[2, 6]`) to the **flag** (`flag_obj` at position `[7, 7]`). However, the path is blocked by **Goop** objects (`goop_obj`) that are harmful because of the rule **"Goop is Sink"**. Touching a **Goop** object will cause **Baba** to sink and result in losing the game.

To overcome this, we'll modify the game rules by breaking **"Goop is Sink"**. This can be done by pushing the **"Sink"** word (`sink_word`) out of the sentence, effectively disabling the sinking property of the Goop.

Here are the detailed steps of the action sequence:

1. **Move Down 4 times**:
   - From `[2, 6]` to `[2, 2]`.
   - This positions Baba below the cluster of **Goop** objects and avoids immediate danger.

2. **Move Right 5 times**:
   - From `[2, 2]` to `[7, 2]`.
   - We are now adjacent to the **"Is"** word (`is_word` at `[7, 2]`) in the **"Goop is Sink"** sentence.

3. **Push "Is" Down**:
   - Move **Down** once to push the **"Is"** word from `[7, 2]` to `[7, 1]`.
   - This clears the vertical path above and begins breaking the **"Goop is Sink"** rule.

4. **Move Right to "Sink"**:
   - Move **Right** once to `[8, 2]`, where the **"Sink"** word is located.

5. **Push "Sink" Up**:
   - Move **Up** once to push **"Sink"** from `[8, 2]` to `[8, 3]`.
   - This completes the disruption of **"Goop is Sink"**, removing the sinking property from Goop.

6. **Move Back Left**:
   - Move **Left** once to return to `[7, 2]`.

7. **Move Up 5 times to the Flag**:
   - From `[7, 2]`, move **Up** 5 times to reach `[7, 7]`.
   - **Goop** objects at `[7, 4]` and `[7, 5]` are no longer harmful and can be passed through.
   - Upon reaching `[7, 7]`, Baba touches the **Flag**, which, per the rule **"Flag is Win"**, wins the game.

By breaking the **"Goop is Sink"** rule, we safely navigate through the **Goop** objects and reach the **Flag**. This action sequence successfully results in winning the level.
