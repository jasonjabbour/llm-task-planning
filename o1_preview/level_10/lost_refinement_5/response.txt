Explanation:

To win the level, we need to navigate Baba to reach the flag at position `[7, 7]` without touching the goop objects, which are sink tiles that cause Baba to be destroyed upon contact. Here is the reasoning behind the action sequence:

1. **Move Down 4 times**: 
   - Actions: `["down", "down", "down", "down"]`
   - Position changes:
     - `[2, 6]` → `[2, 5]` → `[2, 4]` → `[2, 3]` → `[2, 2]`
   - This moves Baba down to an empty path that avoids the goop objects on the right.

2. **Move Right 2 times**:
   - Actions: `["right", "right"]`
   - Position changes:
     - `[2, 2]` → `[3, 2]` → `[4, 2]`
   - Baba moves right through empty spaces, still avoiding goop objects.

3. **Move Up, Right, Up, Right, Up, Right, Up**:
   - Actions: `["up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up"]`
   - Position changes:
     - `[4, 2]` → `[4, 3]` → `[5, 3]` → `[5, 4]` → `[6, 4]` → `[6, 5]` → `[7, 5]` → `[7, 6]` → `[8, 6]` → `[8, 7]` → `[9, 7]`
   - Baba navigates upwards and rightwards, threading through the empty spaces between goop objects to reach the vicinity of the flag.

4. **Final Position**:
   - Baba reaches position `[7, 7]`, where the flag is located.

Throughout this path, Baba avoids all goop objects and doesn't push any words that might alter the existing rules ("BABA IS YOU" and "FLAG IS WIN"). By following this sequence, Baba reaches the flag without causing a loss condition, and since "FLAG IS WIN" is in effect, touching the flag results in winning the game.
