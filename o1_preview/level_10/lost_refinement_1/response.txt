Explanation:

In the previous attempt, we tried to reach the flag but were unable to cross the goop because "goop is sink". This means stepping on goop causes us to sink and lose the game. To solve this, we need to break the "goop is sink" rule.

Here's how the corrected action sequence works:

1. **Move Down 4 times**: This moves Baba from position `[2,6]` to `[2,2]`.
2. **Move Right 4 times**: Baba moves from `[2,2]` to `[6,2]`. Along the way, we push the "goop" word from `[6,2]` down to `[6,1]`, breaking the "goop is sink" rule because "goop" is no longer adjacent to "is" and "sink".
3. **Move Up 3 times**: Baba moves over the goop safely from `[6,2]` to `[6,5]` since it's no longer "sink".
4. **Move Right once**: Baba moves to `[7,5]`.
5. **Move Up 2 times**: Baba reaches the flag at `[7,7]`.

By breaking the "goop is sink" rule, we can cross the goop without sinking. Reaching the flag, which is still "win", allows us to win the level.
