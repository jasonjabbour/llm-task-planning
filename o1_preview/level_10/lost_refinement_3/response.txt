```Python
["down", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "left", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right"]
```

**Explanation:**

In the initial state, the rule **"Goop is Sink"** is active due to the alignment of the words **"goop"**, **"is"**, and **"sink"** at positions `[6, 2]`, `[7, 2]`, and `[8, 2]`, respectively. This means that any interaction with **goop** objects results in sinking and losing the game. To win the level, we need to disable this rule so that **Baba** can pass through the **goop** without sinking and reach the **flag** at position `[7, 7]`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the action sequence:

1. **Move Down x4**: `["down", "down", "down", "down"]`  
   Baba moves from `[2, 6]` to `[2, 2]`, reaching the row of the **"Goop is Sink"** rule.

2. **Move Right x4**: `["right", "right", "right", "right"]`  
   Baba moves from `[2, 2]` to `[6, 2]`, arriving at the **"goop"** word tile.

3. **Push "goop" Word Left**: `["left"]`  
   Baba pushes the **"goop"** word at `[6, 2]` to `[5, 2]`, breaking the alignment and disabling the **"Goop is Sink"** rule.

4. **Move Up x5**: `["up", "up", "up", "up", "up"]`  
   Baba moves from `[5, 2]` to `[5, 7]`, navigating back through the path without the risk of sinking.

5. **Move Right x2**: `["right", "right"]`  
   Baba moves from `[5, 7]` to `[7, 7]`, reaching the **flag** object.

By breaking the **"Goop is Sink"** rule, Baba can safely pass through the goop objects. Reaching the flag at `[7, 7]` with the active rule **"Flag is Win"** results in winning the level.
