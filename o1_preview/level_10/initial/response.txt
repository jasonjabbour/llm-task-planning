Explanation:

To win the level, we need to reach the flag at position (7,7). However, our path is blocked by 'goop_obj' which we cannot pass through. To overcome this, we need to create the rule "GOOP IS SINK" to eliminate the 'goop_obj's that block our path.

Here are the steps:

1. **Move to the 'goop_word' at (6,2):**
   - From our starting position at (2,6), move down four times to reach (2,2).
   - Then move right four times to reach (6,2), where the 'goop_word' is.
   
2. **Push 'goop_word' to form "GOOP IS SINK":**
   - Push the 'goop_word' right three times. This pushes 'is_word' and 'sink_word' to the right as well, forming the horizontal sentence "GOOP IS SINK" at positions (6,2) to (8,2).
   
3. **Eliminate the blocking 'goop_obj':**
   - Now that "GOOP IS SINK" is in effect, 'goop_obj's will be eliminated when touched.
   - Move back to the blocking 'goop_obj' at (4,7) by moving up, then left four times to return to (2,6), and then up to (2,8).
   - Move right to reach and eliminate the 'goop_obj' at (4,7).
   
4. **Reach the flag:**
   - With the 'goop_obj' at (4,7) eliminated, we can now proceed to the flag.
   - Move right three times to reach (7,7), where the flag is located.

By following these actions, we create a new rule that allows us to remove obstacles and reach the flag to win the level.
