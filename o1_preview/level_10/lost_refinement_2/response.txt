Explanation:

In this corrected action sequence, we guide Baba to win the level by first breaking the rule that makes Goop dangerous, and then reaching the Flag.

- **Steps 1-4:** We move Baba down four times to get from the starting position at `[2, 6]` to `[2, 2]`. This positions Baba at the bottom row, directly in line with the "is" word in the "Goop is Sink" rule.

- **Steps 5-9:** We move Baba right five times to reach `[7, 2]`, placing Baba next to the "is" word at `[7, 2]` that is part of the "Goop is Sink" rule.

- **Step 10:** Moving right once more, we push the "is" word from `[7, 2]` to `[8, 2]`, and the "Sink" word from `[8, 2]` to `[9, 2]`. This breaks the "Goop is Sink" rule because the words are no longer aligned to form the rule. As a result, Goop no longer has the sink property, and Baba can safely move over Goop tiles without being destroyed.

- **Steps 11-15:** We move Baba up five times from `[7, 2]` to `[7, 7]`. Even though there are Goop tiles at `[7, 4]` and `[7, 5]`, since Goop is no longer Sink, Baba can move over these tiles safely. On reaching `[7, 7]`, where the Flag is located, Baba wins the level because "Flag is Win" is still an active rule.

By breaking the "Goop is Sink" rule and then moving to the Flag, this action sequence results in winning the level.
