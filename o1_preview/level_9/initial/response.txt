```Python

["up", "up", "right", "right", "down", "right", "down", "down", "right", "up"]

```

**Explanation:**

Starting from our initial position at `[2,5]`, we need to break the rule "Skull is Kill" to safely reach the flag. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **First Move Up Twice (`"up", "up"`):**
   - We move up to `[2,6]` and then to `[2,7]`. At `[2,7]`, there's the `'is_word'`. By moving up again, we push the `'is_word'` to `[2,8]`, effectively breaking the "Skull is Kill" rule because the sentence is now incomplete.

2. **Move Towards the Flag:**
   - **Right Twice (`"right", "right"`):**
     - We move right to `[3,7]` (where `'kill_word'` is) and then to `[4,7]`.
   - **Down (`"down"`):**
     - We move down to `[4,6]`.
   - **Right (`"right"`):**
     - We move right to `[5,6]`, entering the area with skulls. Since "Skull is Kill" has been broken, skulls no longer harm us.
   - **Down Twice (`"down", "down"`):**
     - We move down to `[5,5]` and then to `[5,4]`, continuing through the skulls.
   - **Right (`"right"`):**
     - We move right to `[6,4]`.
   - **Up (`"up"`):**
     - Finally, we move up to `[6,5]`, where the `'flag_obj'` is located.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - Stepping onto the flag triggers the win condition because "Flag is Win" is still in effect. By breaking "Skull is Kill" and reaching the flag, we successfully complete the level.

This sequence allows us to safely navigate through hazards by altering the game rules to our advantage and reaching the goal.
