```Python
["left", "left", "left", "left", "left"]
```

**Explanation:**

In the given initial state, we control the `love_obj` which is located at position **(7, 3)**. Our goal is to win the level by utilizing the existing rules and objects on the map.

Looking at the state, we notice that there is a rule already in place at the bottom of the map:
- **GRASS IS WIN** is formed by the words at positions:
  - `grass_word` at **(1, 1)**
  - `is_word` at **(2, 1)**
  - `win_word` at **(3, 1)**

This rule means that touching any `grass_obj` will allow us to win the level.

There is a `grass_obj` located at position **(2, 3)**. Our strategy is to move the `love_obj` leftwards to reach the `grass_obj`. 

**Step-by-Step Actions:**

1. **First Left Move**:
   - Move from **(7, 3)** to **(6, 3)**
   - Cell **(6, 3)** is empty.

2. **Second Left Move**:
   - Move from **(6, 3)** to **(5, 3)**
   - Cell **(5, 3)** is empty.

3. **Third Left Move**:
   - Move from **(5, 3)** to **(4, 3)**
   - Cell **(4, 3)** is empty.

4. **Fourth Left Move**:
   - Move from **(4, 3)** to **(3, 3)**
   - Cell **(3, 3)** is empty.

5. **Fifth Left Move**:
   - Move from **(3, 3)** to **(2, 3)**
   - Cell **(2, 3)** contains `grass_obj`.

Upon reaching **(2, 3)** and touching the `grass_obj`, we trigger the **GRASS IS WIN** condition, thereby winning the level.

This sequence efficiently utilizes the existing rules and requires only five moves to achieve victory.
