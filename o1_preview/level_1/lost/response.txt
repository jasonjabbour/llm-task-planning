["right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "down", "down", "down", "down", "right"]
```

**Explanation:**

Our goal is to win the level by creating the rule **"FLAG IS WIN"** and then touching the flag.

**Understanding the Initial State:**

- **Controlled Object:** We control **`baba_obj`** located at position **[2, 4]**.
- **Current Rules:**
  - The words **"BABA IS YOU"** are positioned horizontally at the top:

    ```
    [1,8]: 'BABA'
    [2,8]: 'IS'
    [3,8]: 'YOU'
    ```

    This rule allows us to control **Baba**.

  - The words **"FLAG IS WIN"** are not formed yet. The words are scattered:

    ```
    [6,5]: 'FLAG'
    [7,8]: 'IS'
    [8,8]: 'WIN'
    ```

- **Goal:** Form the rule **"FLAG IS WIN"** by aligning the words horizontally and then touch the **flag object** at **[7,4]**.

**Action Sequence Breakdown:**

1. **Move to the 'FLAG' Word:**

   - **Actions:** `"right", "right", "right", "up"`
   - **Movement:**
     - `[2,4]` → `[3,4]` (right)
     - `[3,4]` → `[4,4]` (right)
     - `[4,4]` → `[5,4]` (right)
     - `[5,4]` → `[5,5]` (up)
     - `[5,5]` → `[6,5]` (automatically overlap with 'FLAG' word)
   - **Purpose:** Reach the **'FLAG' word** at `[6,5]`.

2. **Push the 'FLAG' Word Upwards:**

   - **Actions:** `"up", "up", "up"`
   - **Movement & Result:**
     - Push 'FLAG' from `[6,5]` to `[6,6]`
     - Push 'FLAG' from `[6,6]` to `[6,7]`
     - Push 'FLAG' from `[6,7]` to `[6,8]`
   - **Outcome:** The 'FLAG' word is now at `[6,8]`, forming the horizontal rule:

     ```
     [6,8]: 'FLAG'
     [7,8]: 'IS'
     [8,8]: 'WIN'
     ```

     This creates the rule **"FLAG IS WIN"**.

3. **Move to the Flag Object:**

   - **Actions:** `"down", "down", "down", "down", "right"`
   - **Movement:**
     - `[6,8]` → `[6,7]` (down)
     - `[6,7]` → `[6,6]` (down)
     - `[6,6]` → `[6,5]` (down)
     - `[6,5]` → `[6,4]` (down)
     - `[6,4]` → `[7,4]` (right)
   - **Purpose:** Reach the **flag object** at `[7,4]`.

**Why This Leads to Victory:**

- By forming **"FLAG IS WIN"**, we assign the **WIN** property to the flag.
- Touching the flag at `[7,4]` while controlling **Baba** results in winning the level.
- We ensure not to break the existing **"BABA IS YOU"** rule, so we maintain control over Baba throughout.

**Conclusion:**

This sequence efficiently accomplishes the goal by manipulating the game's rules and reaching the victory condition without any unnecessary moves. By understanding the game mechanics and strategically moving the words, we successfully complete the level.
