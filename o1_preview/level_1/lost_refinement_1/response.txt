```Python
['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right']
```

Explanation:

In the previous attempt, the action sequence included four 'down' moves after pushing the 'flag_word' upwards:

```
['right', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right']
```

This caused **Baba** to move from position `[6,7]` down to `[6,3]`, overshooting the correct position by one tile. As a result, when Baba moved 'right' at the end, he ended up at `[7,3]`, which did not allow him to interact with the **flag_obj** at `[7,4]`.

By correcting the action sequence to include only **three 'down' moves** instead of four, Baba will move from `[6,7]` down to `[6,4]`. The final 'right' move then takes Baba to `[7,4]`, where the **flag_obj** is located.

Here's the corrected sequence:

1. **'right' x4**: Move Baba from `[2,4]` to `[6,4]`.
2. **'up' x3**: Push the **flag_word** from `[6,5]` up to `[6,8]`, forming the rule **'Flag Is Win'** horizontally at y=8.
3. **'down' x3**: Move Baba back down to `[6,4]`.
4. **'right' x1**: Move Baba to `[7,4]`, where the **flag_obj** is located.

With the rule **'Flag Is Win'** now active and Baba touching the **flag_obj**, the game is won.
