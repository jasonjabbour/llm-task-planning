```Python
["left", "left", "left", "right", "right", "right"]
```

Explanation:

In the initial state, we control `baba_obj` located at position `[5, 4]`. Our goal is to win the level by forming the rule `BABA IS WIN`, which will make us win immediately upon creating this rule.

Hereâ€™s how the action sequence leads to victory:

1. **First Action - "left":**
   - Move `baba_obj` from `[5, 4]` to `[4, 4]`.
   - This space is empty, so the move is valid.

2. **Second Action - "left":**
   - Move `baba_obj` from `[4, 4]` to `[3, 4]`.
   - This space is also empty.

3. **Third Action - "left":**
   - Move `baba_obj` from `[3, 4]` to `[2, 4]`.
   - At `[2, 4]`, there is the `win_word`.
   - Since objects in the game can push words, `baba_obj` will push `win_word` to the right as it moves into `[2, 4]`.

4. **Fourth Action - "right":**
   - Push `win_word` from `[3, 4]` to `[4, 4]` while `baba_obj` moves to `[3, 4]`.
   - The `win_word` is now at `[4, 4]`.

5. **Fifth Action - "right":**
   - Push `win_word` from `[4, 4]` to `[5, 4]` while `baba_obj` moves to `[4, 4]`.
   - The `win_word` is now at `[5, 4]`.

6. **Sixth Action - "right":**
   - Move `baba_obj` to `[5, 4]`.
   - Since `win_word` is at `[5, 4]`, it gets pushed to `[6, 4]`.
   
After these actions, the words are aligned to form the horizontal sentence `BABA IS WIN`:

- `baba_word` at `[4, 7]` (unchanged).
- `is_word` at `[5, 7]` (unchanged).
- `win_word` now at `[5, 4]` (after being pushed).

However, to complete the rule `BABA IS WIN`, we need `win_word` to be directly beneath `is_word` because both `baba_word` and `is_word` are at row `7` and `win_word` is at row `4`. Since we cannot directly move `win_word` up to row `7` due to obstacles and the risk of losing the game (as per past attempts), we can instead adjust the rule vertically.

But given the constraints and available moves, aligning `win_word` at `[5, 7]` is not possible without triggering a loss. Hence, by pushing `win_word` to `[5, 4]`, we attempt to form `BABA IS WIN` horizontally at row `4`.

However, upon further analysis, it's clear that the words `baba_word` and `is_word` are still at row `7`, and `win_word` is at row `4`, so they are not connected to form a valid rule. This action sequence doesn't result in winning the level.

**Correction:**

To correctly form `BABA IS WIN`, we need all three words aligned either horizontally or vertically without gaps. Since moving up results in losing the game, we'll adjust our strategy to form the rule vertically.

**Updated Action Sequence:**

```Python
["left", "left", "left", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up"]
```

**Updated Explanation:**

1. **First Three Actions - "left" x3:**
   - Move `baba_obj` from `[5, 4]` to `[2, 4]`, pushing `win_word` left if necessary.
2. **Next Three Actions - "down" x3:**
   - Move `baba_obj` down to `[2, 1]`.
3. **Next Three Actions - "right" x3:**
   - Move `baba_obj` from `[2, 1]` to `[5, 1]`.
4. **Final Three Actions - "up" x3:**
   - Move `baba_obj` up to `[5, 4]`, pushing any words upwards.

By moving around the bottom of the map, we avoid the area that causes us to lose the game when moving up directly. Upon reaching `[5, 4]` from below, we can now push `win_word` upwards to align with `is_word` and `baba_word` to form `BABA IS WIN` vertically.

**Why This Works:**

- We avoid moving into the hazardous area that caused a loss in previous attempts.
- We successfully position `win_word` to form the rule `BABA IS WIN`.
- Forming `BABA IS WIN` changes the property of `baba_obj` to be a winning object.
- Since we control `baba_obj`, and it now has the property of `WIN`, we instantly win the game upon forming the rule.
