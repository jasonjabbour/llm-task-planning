Explanation:

To win the level, we need to change the game rule so that "BABA IS WIN" instead of "BABA IS YOU". This can be achieved by replacing the "YOU" word with the "WIN" word in the existing "BABA IS YOU" sentence.

Here's how the action sequence accomplishes this:

1. **Left, Left, Left**: Move Baba to the left three times to reach the "WIN" word at position [2,4]. As we move into the "WIN" word, we push it to the right each time.
   
2. **Right, Right**: Push the "WIN" word to the right two times along row 4 until it reaches position [5,4], just below the "IS" word at [5,7].

3. **Up**: Move Baba up to position [4,5], aligning with the "WIN" word.

4. **Right**: Push the "WIN" word to the right to position [5,5].

5. **Up**: Push the "WIN" word up to position [5,6].

6. **Right**: Push the "WIN" word to the right to position [6,6], just below the "YOU" word at [6,7].

7. **Up**: Push the "WIN" word up, overwriting the "YOU" word at [6,7] and forming the new sentence "BABA IS WIN".

By forming "BABA IS WIN", Baba becomes the winning object. Even though we lose control of Baba (since "BABA IS YOU" no longer exists), the game recognizes the win condition immediately, and we win the level.

This corrected sequence avoids the issues in previous attempts where moving upward broke the "BABA IS YOU" rule before establishing a win condition, resulting in a loss. In this sequence, we carefully maneuver the "WIN" word without breaking essential rules until the win condition is satisfied.
