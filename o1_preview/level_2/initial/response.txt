```Python
['up', 'up', 'up', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'up']
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Move Up thrice**:  
   - Starting from position `[5, 4]`, moving up three times takes `baba_obj` to `[5, 7]`.
   - This pushes the `you_word` at `[6, 7]` to the right, moving it to `[7, 7]`.
   - This creates an empty space at `[6, 7]` for the `win_word`.

2. **Move Down thrice**:  
   - Moving down three times brings `baba_obj` back to the initial position `[5, 4]`.
   - This prepares `baba_obj` to push the `win_word` towards the empty space.

3. **Move Left thrice**:  
   - Moving left three times takes `baba_obj` to `[2, 4]`, reaching the `win_word`.
   - Each left move pushes the `win_word` one step to the right:
     - `win_word` moves from `[2, 4]` to `[3, 4]`, `[4, 4]`, and finally `[5, 4]`.

4. **Move Right thrice**:  
   - Moving right three times, `baba_obj` pushes the `win_word` from `[5, 4]` to `[6, 4]`.
   - The `win_word` is now aligned below the empty space at `[6, 7]`.

5. **Move Up thrice**:  
   - Moving up three times, `baba_obj` pushes the `win_word` upwards from `[6, 4]` to `[6, 7]`.
   - With each move, `win_word` occupies `[6, 5]`, `[6, 6]`, and finally `[6, 7]`.

**Result:**

- The phrase **"BABA IS WIN"** is formed horizontally at row 7 with:
  - `baba_word` at `[4, 7]`
  - `is_word` at `[5, 7]`
  - `win_word` at `[6, 7]`

- Since `baba_obj` is `YOU` (from the existing "BABA IS YOU") and now `BABA IS WIN`, the game conditions for winning are met.

- **Victory is achieved** by following this sequence of actions.
