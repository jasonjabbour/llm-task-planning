```Python
["left", "left", "left", "down", "down", "right", "up", "right", "up", "up"]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Move Left thrice**: `left`, `left`, `left`
   - Baba moves from `[5, 4]` to `[2, 4]`, reaching the position of the `win_word`.
2. **Push `win_word` Down twice**: `down`, `down`
   - Baba pushes the `win_word` from `[2, 4]` to `[2, 2]`.
3. **Move Right**: `right`
   - Baba moves to `[3, 2]`, alongside the `win_word`.
4. **Push `win_word` Right**: `up`
   - Baba pushes the `win_word` from `[2, 2]` to `[2, 3]`.
5. **Move Right**: `right`
   - Baba moves to `[3, 3]`.
6. **Push `win_word` Up**: `up`
   - Baba pushes the `win_word` from `[3, 3]` to `[3, 4]`.
7. **Move Up twice**: `up`, `up`
   - Baba moves to `[3, 6]`, avoiding the problematic row `y=7`.

By following these steps, Baba pushes the `win_word` into position to form the vertical phrase `BABA IS WIN`:

- `BABA` at `[4, 7]`
- `IS` at `[4, 6]`
- `WIN` at `[4, 5]`

This changes the game rule to `BABA IS WIN`, allowing Baba to win the level without moving into the `y=7` row that previously caused the game to be lost.
