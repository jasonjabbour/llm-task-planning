```Python
["left", "left", "left", "left", "up", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up"]
```

**Explanation:**

To win the level, we need to form the sentence **"BABA IS WIN"** without breaking the existing **"BABA IS YOU"** rule. In the previous attempt, moving up three times caused us to push the **"IS"** word out of position at **[5, 7]**, breaking the **"BABA IS YOU"** rule and resulting in a loss.

Here's how the corrected action sequence works:

1. **"left", "left", "left", "left":** Move Baba left from **[5, 4]** to **[1, 4]**, pushing the **"WIN"** word from **[2, 4]** to the right. The **"WIN"** word ends up at **[5, 4]** after these moves.

2. **"up":** Move Baba up to **[1, 5]**. This positions Baba to push the **"WIN"** word upwards in the next steps.

3. **"right", "right", "right":** Move Baba right from **[1, 5]** to **[4, 5]**, pushing the **"WIN"** word from **[5, 4]** upwards to **[5, 5]**, **[5, 6]**, and finally **[5, 7]**.

4. **"up", "up":** Move Baba up twice to **[4, 7]** and then **[4, 8]**. This avoids interfering with the **"IS"** word at **[5, 7]** (since we've already moved **"WIN"** to that position). 

By pushing the **"WIN"** word to **[5, 7]**, we form the horizontal sentence **"BABA IS WIN"** at positions **[4, 7]**, **[5, 7]**, and **[6, 7]**. This changes the game rule so that **Baba is Win**, and since we are controlling Baba (**"BABA IS YOU"** is still intact), we win the level upon forming this new rule.

**Note:** This sequence ensures we do not break the **"BABA IS YOU"** rule by avoiding pushing or displacing the **"IS"** word at **[5, 7]**.
