Based on the initial state, the goal is to move the 'baba\_obj' to the 'win\_word' location at [8, 8]. However, in the previous actions, the 'baba\_obj' was moved to an invalid position at [8, 2], which is not on the 'win\_word'.

To win the level, we need to correct the path to the 'win\_word'. Here is the corrected action sequence:

```Python
actions = ['right', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']
```

Explanation:

1. 'right': Move 'baba\_obj' to the right, from [2, 5] to [3, 5].
2. 'up': Move 'baba\_obj' up, from [3, 5] to [3, 6].
3. 'up': Move 'baba\_obj' up, from [3, 6] to [3, 7].
4. 'up': Move 'baba\_obj' up, from [3, 7] to [3, 8].
5. 'up': Move 'baba\_obj' up, from [3, 8] to [2, 8].
6. 'right': Move 'baba\_obj' to the right, from [2, 8] to [3, 8].
7. 'right': Move 'baba\_obj' to the right, from [3, 8] to [4, 8].
8. 'right': Move 'baba\_obj' to the right, from [4, 8] to [5, 8].
9. 'right': Move 'baba\_obj' to the right, from [5, 8] to [6, 8].
10. 'right': Move 'baba\_obj' to the right, from [6, 8] to [7, 8].
11. 'right': Move 'baba\_obj' to the right, from [7, 8] to [8, 8].
12. 'right': Move 'baba\_obj' to the right, from [8, 8] to [9, 8].

This sequence will move the 'baba\_obj' to the 'win\_word' location at [8, 8] and win the level.
