Based on the initial state and the history of previous actions, it seems that the AI agent is controlling the "baba_obj" object. The objective of the game is to reach the "win_word" object located at position (8, 8) by moving within the grid defined by the "border" list. 

The previous actions have been trying to move the agent horizontally to the right or vertically upwards, but they did not reach the objective. Given the initial state, the agent can win the game by following this sequence of actions:

```Python
["up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]
```

explanation:

1. Move the agent upwards 8 times to reach the same column as the "win_word" object.
2. Then, move the agent to the right 13 times to reach the "win_word" object.

The reason this sequence of actions should work is because it brings the agent to the position of the "win_word" object, without encountering any obstacles from the provided initial state or the game's rules.
