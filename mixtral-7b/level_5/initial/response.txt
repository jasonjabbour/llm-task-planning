Based on the given state, it appears that the goal is to move the "you\_word" object to the location of the "win\_word" object to win the level. The "you\_word" object is currently located at position (3, 8) and the "win\_word" object is at position (8, 8). The "baba\_obj" object, which we have control over, is at position (2, 5). To reach the "win\_word" object from our current position, we can follow these steps:

1. Move the "baba\_obj" object to the empty space at position (3, 5) by moving one space to the right and then down one space.
2. Push the "rock\_obj" object at position (7, 5) out of the way by moving the "baba\_obj" object into it.
3. Move the "baba\_obj" object onto the "is\_word" object at position (2, 3) to convert it into the "baba\_word" object.
4. Move the "baba\_word" object back to position (2, 5) to free up the "rock\_word" object at position (2, 3).
5. Push the "rock\_word" object out of the way by moving the "baba\_word" object into it.
6. Move the "baba\_word" object onto the "is\_word" object at position (8, 3) to convert it into the "you\_word" object.

The sequence of actions to execute these steps is as follows:

```Python
["right", "down", "up", "up", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right"]
```

Note that the actions provided assume that the "baba\_obj" object always moves before any other object, and that objects can be moved onto empty spaces or "is\_word" objects, but not onto other objects. If these assumptions do not hold, the strategy may need to be adjusted accordingly.
