Based on the initial state, the goal is to get the "baba\_obj" to the location of the "win\_word" which is at position [8, 8]. The previous action sequences did not result in winning the game, so I will provide a corrected action sequence.

The first problem I notice in the previous action sequences is that they don't take into account the location of the "win\_word". In Previous Actions 1, the "baba\_obj" moves to the right, down, and up repeatedly, but it never moves to the left. In Previous Actions 2, the "baba\_obj" moves up repeatedly, but it never moves to the right.

Here is the corrected action sequence:

```Python
actions = ['right', 'down', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'up']
```

explanation:

The action sequence starts by moving the "baba\_obj" to the right, down, and right again, to get it to the same row as the "win\_word". Then it moves down repeatedly until it reaches the correct column. Finally, it moves up once to reach the exact position of the "win\_word". This action sequence should result in winning the game.
