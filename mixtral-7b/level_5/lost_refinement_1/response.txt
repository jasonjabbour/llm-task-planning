Based on the initial state, the objective is to move the 'baba\_obj' to the location of the 'win\_word', which is at position [8, 8]. However, in the previous actions, the 'baba\_obj' was moved towards the right and down, ending up at position [8, 2]. To correct this, we need to move the 'baba\_obj' to the left and upward to reach the desired position. Here are the corrected actions:

```python
["left", "up", "up", "left", "up", "up", "up", "left", "up", "left", "up"]
```
Explanation:
We first move the 'baba\_obj' to the left, then go up until we reach the desired position at [8, 8]. Also, since the initial state won and lost attributes are set to False, winning the game will require updating the 'won' attribute to True in the environment.
