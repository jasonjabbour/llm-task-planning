Based on the initial state, it seems that the 'baba_obj' is one step away from the 'keke_obj', but they are separated by a wall ('wall_obj'). To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' so that it is on top of the 'keke_obj' (as indicated by the 'keke_word' and 'baba_word').

Based on the previous action histories, the actions taken did not result in victory because the 'baba_obj' was moved in the wrong direction, or the direction was not optimal.

My suggested corrected action sequence, taking the above into account, is as follows:

```Python
actions = ['down']
```

explanation:

The action 'down' is selected to move the 'baba_obj' one step down, which will place it on top of the 'flag_obj'. Following this, the 'baba_obj' will remain on top of the 'flag_obj' while the 'flag_word' moves to the destination position. The 'flag_obj' and 'flag_word' will then merge, resulting in a victory state. Selecting 'down' also avoids encountering any wall objects.
