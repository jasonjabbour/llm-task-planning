Based on the provided state and history, it seems that the main goal is to move the 'baba\_obj' to the 'flag\_obj' location while avoiding dead ends or going out of bounds. The previous action sequences did not result in winning the game, and I noticed that the 'baba\_obj' was moved right next to the 'flag\_obj' in the first attempt, but it didn't win as 'baba\_obj' should be on the 'flag\_obj' location.

Here is a corrected action sequence:

```Python
["up"]
```

explanation:

This action will move the 'baba\_obj' from (7, 5) to (7, 4), placing it on top of the 'flag\_obj' at (6, 4), which results in winning. The 'won' parameter will be set to True when the 'baba\_obj' is on the 'flag\_obj'.
