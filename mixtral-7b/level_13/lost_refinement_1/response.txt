Based on the provided history, it seems that in the previous attempt, the AI agent moved the `baba_obj` object to the right and then up, ending up at position (7, 5). However, the goal is to get the `baba_obj` to the `flag_obj` located at position (6, 7).

The issue with the previous attempt is that the AI agent moved the object to a position that is further away from the flag. Instead, the AI agent should move the object closer to the flag.

Here are the corrected sequence of actions:

```Python
["up", "left"]
```

explanation:

The AI agent should first move the `baba_obj` object up, to position (6, 5), which is closer to the `flag_obj`. Then, the AI agent should move the object to the left, to position (6, 4), which is directly on top of the `flag_obj`, thus winning the game.
