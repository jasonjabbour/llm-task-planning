Explanation:

In the given state, we are currently controlling the 'baba\_obj' which is located at position (6, 4). Our goal is to win the game, which can be achieved by reaching the 'flag\_obj' located at position (6, 7). To do this, we need to move our 'baba\_obj' object towards the right, since the 'flag\_obj' is to the right of the 'baba\_obj'. Afterward, we need to move up to reach the flag. Here are the corresponding actions:

Actions:
```python
["right", "up"]
```
The reason for this sequence is that it's the shortest path to reach the 'flag\_obj' and win. We cannot move left, down, or diagonally because other objects or walls would block the path. Also, moving left or down would not help us reach the flag faster, as it is located to the right and above our current position.

After making these moves, the state should change, and the 'won' flag will be set to True when the 'baba\_obj' reaches the 'flag\_obj' position.
