Based on the initial state, the goal is to move the "baba\_obj" to the "flag\_obj" location at (5, 8). In the previous action sequences, the agent moved "baba\_obj" to (8, 5) and (6, 5), but those did not lead to winning the game.

To win the game, the agent should do the following:

1. Move "baba\_obj" two steps to the right, to (7, 4). This will avoid the "wall\_word" at (2, 5).
2. Move "baba\_obj" up to (7, 5).
3. Move "baba\_obj" up to (7, 6), where it will land on a "wall\_obj".
4. From (7, 6), move "baba\_obj" two steps to the right, to (9, 6).
5. Move "baba\_obj" down from (9, 6) to (8, 6).
6. Finally, move "baba\_obj" up to the "flag\_obj" at (5, 8).

With these actions, the agent will avoid the "wall\_word" and "stop\_word", and it will reach the "flag\_obj" to win the game.

Here's the action sequence as a string, enclosed in the required markup tag:

```Python
["right", "right", "up", "up", "right", "right", "down", "up"]
```

This sequence should allow the agent to win the game, as it avoids the "wall\_word" and "stop\_word", and it successfully moves "baba\_obj" to the "flag\_obj" location.
