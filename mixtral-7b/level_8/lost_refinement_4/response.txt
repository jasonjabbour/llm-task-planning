Based on the initial state and the history provided, it seems that the AI agent is trying to move the "baba_obj" to the "flag_obj" at position [5, 8]. However, it is getting stuck near positions [7, 4] and [8, 4/5] due to the "wall_obj" at position [2, 6].

Previous attempts show that the agent is having trouble navigating around the "wall_obj". In action sequence 3, the agent moved down to position [8, 4], but then moved back up to [8, 5], which put it back in the same position as before. In action sequence 4, the agent went up too many times and ended up above the "wall_obj", but did not attempt to move left or right to go around it.

To win the level, the AI agent should move the "baba_obj" up and then left around the "wall_obj" to reach the "flag_obj". Here is the corrected action sequence:

```Python
["up", "left", "up", "left", "up", "left", "up", "left", "up"]
```

This sequence moves the "baba_obj" up and then left around the "wall_obj", reaching the "flag_obj" at position [5, 8]. By moving consistently in one direction, the agent avoids getting stuck near the "wall_obj" as it did in previous attempts. Additionally, this sequence only uses vertical and horizontal movements, avoiding diagonal movements that might cause the agent to overshoot its destination.
