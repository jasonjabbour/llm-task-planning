Based on the initial state, the goal is to move the `baba_obj` to the `flag_obj` located at position (5,8) while avoiding the `wall_obj` and `wall_word`. 

The previous action sequences indicate trying to move horizontally first before moving vertically did not help win the game. Thus, we should try moving vertically first to avoid wasting moves.

Here's the action sequence:

```Python
["up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:

1. Move up twice to avoid `wall_obj` and be on the same x-coordinate as `flag_obj`.
2. Move right five times to reach the same y-coordinate as `flag_obj`.
3. Move up four times to reach the `flag_obj`.
