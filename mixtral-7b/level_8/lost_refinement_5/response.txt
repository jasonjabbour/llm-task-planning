Based on the initial state and the history of previous actions, it seems like the goal is to move the "baba\_obj" to the "flag\_obj" at position [5, 8]. In the last sequence of actions (Previous Actions 5), the "baba\_obj" made it to column 2, but encountered a "wall\_word" at position [2, 5]. Therefore, we need to find a way to get around this wall.

Looking at the initial state, we can see that there is an "empty" space at position [1, 1] and a "stop\_word" at position [2, 3]. By moving the "baba\_obj" to position [1, 1] and then stepping onto the "stop\_word" at [2, 3], we can bypass the wall at [2, 5]. Afterward, we can continue moving up to reach the "flag\_obj" at [5, 8].

Here's the action sequence:

```Python
["left", "down", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:

1. Move left 3 times to reach position [1, 4].
2. Move down once to reach position [1, 3].
3. Move right once to reach position [2, 3] and step onto the "stop\_word".
4. Move up 5 times to reach the "flag\_obj" at position [5, 8].
