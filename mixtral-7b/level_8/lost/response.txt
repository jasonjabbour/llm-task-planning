Explanation:

In the given state, we can see that our 'baba\_obj' is in the position [5, 4] and the 'flag\_obj' is in the position [5, 8]. We need to move the 'baba\_obj' to the position of the 'flag\_obj' to win the game. The shortest path to the 'flag\_obj' is towards the right, so our first action will be "right". We need to go up two positions after reaching the column of the 'flag\_obj', so our next action will be "up". Now, we need to move two steps towards the left to reach the 'flag\_obj', hence the third action will be "left". At this point, we have reached the 'flag\_obj', but we are one step below it. The final action will be "up" to reach the 'flag\_obj' and win the game.

Actions:
```Python
["right", "up", "left", "up"]
```
