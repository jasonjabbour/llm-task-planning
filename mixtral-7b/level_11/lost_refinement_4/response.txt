Based on the replay buffer from the previous action sequences, it seems that the main issue was going out of bounds by moving the "baba_obj" to a position outside the game grid. In order to prevent this, we need to make sure that the object stays within the grid boundaries.

In the initial state, the "baba_obj" is at [2, 6] which is not directly touching the "flag_word" at [1, 7]. To win, we need to move "baba_obj" to the "flag_word" at [1, 7] while staying within the grid boundaries. Here's a corrected action sequence to achieve that:

```Python
["up", "up", "left"]
```

explanation:

1. Move up by two positions moving the "baba_obj" from [2, 6] to [2, 8] to be directly above the "flag_word".
2. Move up again by one position moving the "baba_obj" from [2, 8] to [2, 9] to be outside the grid border on the top.
3. Move left by one position moving the "baba_obj" from [2, 9] to [1, 9] and land on the "flag_word" to win.
