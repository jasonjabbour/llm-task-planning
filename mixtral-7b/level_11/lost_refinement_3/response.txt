Based on the replay buffer from the previous attempts, it seems that the main issue is going out of bounds or falling into the "sink" at (1, 1). In Previous Actions 1, the baba_obj goes right for too many steps, and in Previous Actions 2, it goes up for too many steps. Both of these cases result in going out of bounds.

To fix this, I propose the following action sequence:

```Python
["up", "up", "up", "up", "left", "up", "left", "up", "left", "left", "left", "left"]
```

Explanation:
1. Move up three times to position the baba_obj next to "goop" at (1, 6).
2. Move left along the top row to position the baba_obj over the "flag" at (1, 7).
3. Move up and then left to reach the "win" position at (3, 7). The sequence "up", "left" is chosen because going left along the top row prevents going out of bounds and losing the game.

By making these adjustments, the agent should be able to avoid going out of bounds and falling into the sink, eventually leading to winning the level. Note that this action sequence considers the initial state provided. If future levels have different initial states, the action sequence should be adjusted accordingly.
