Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the given information, here's the sequence of actions that I propose to win the level:

Actions:
```Python
["up", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```
Explanation:
The goal of this level is to move the `baba_obj` to the location of the `win_word` at (3,7). To achieve this, we need to move the `baba_obj` up and right while avoiding obstacles such as the `goop_obj`, `rock_obj`, and `border`.

First, we need to move the `baba_obj` up to avoid the `goop_obj` and `rock_obj` at the bottom row. Specifically, we need to move the `baba_obj` up to (2,6) to be on top of the `rock_obj` at (2,1) and (8,1), which will prevent it from sinking.

Next, we need to move the `baba_obj` right to reach the (3,7) location, while avoiding the `goop_obj` along the way. To do this, we can move the `baba_obj` right to (3,6), which is on top of the `rock_obj` at (3,3), and then move it up and right to (3,7). This way, we avoid the `goop_obj` that is blocking the direct path from (2,6) to (3,7).

Finally, we can move the `baba_obj` up and right a few more steps to ensure that we are not on top of any `goop_obj` or `rock_obj` that may sink us.

And that's the strategy! By following the action sequence I provided, you should be able to move the `baba_obj` to the location of the `win_word` and win the level.
