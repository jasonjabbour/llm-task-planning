Based on the initial state, the goal is to get the "baba\_obj" to the location of the "flag\_obj" which is at position (7,7). 

The previous attempts show that moving the "baba\_obj" upwards will result in losing the game as there is a "rock\_obj" at position (7,3) and (8,3) which cannot be moved. 

The previous attempts also show that moving the "baba\_obj" to the left will result in losing the game as there is a "goop\_obj" at position (1,6) which cannot be moved. 

Therefore, the action sequence that will result in winning the game is to move the "baba\_obj" to the right until it reaches position (7,6) and then move it up to the position of the "flag\_obj". 

Here's the corrected action sequence:

```python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up"]
```
And explanations for the actions:

* Move to the right 7 times to reach position (7,6)
* Move up 2 times to reach position (7,7)

This action sequence should result in winning the game because it avoids the "rock\_obj" and "goop\_obj" that result in game loss and moves the "baba\_obj" to the position of the "flag\_obj".
