Based on the initial state and the history provided, it seems that the previous action sequences did not take into account the position of the flag object and the goal of the game, which is to move the baba object onto the flag object. In the initial state, the baba object is at position (2, 4) and the flag object is at position (7, 4). The goal is to move the baba object to the position of the flag object.

Here's a corrected action sequence that will result in winning the level:

```Python
actions = []
prev_x, prev_y = 2, 4
while (prev_x, prev_y) != (7, 4):
    actions.append('right')
    prev_x += 1
    
actions.append('up')
```
Explanation:

We first move the baba object to the right until it reaches the same x-coordinate as the flag object (which is 7). Since the flag object has the same y-coordinate as the baba object in the initial state, it suffices to move the baba object to the right until we reach the same x-coordinate.

After that, we move the baba object up once, to reach the same position as the flag object.

This action sequence will lead the baba object in the (7, 4) position, in which case the 'flag\_obj' will be removed in the next state and the 'baba\_obj' will be in the flag\_obj's previous position, thus the game will be won.
