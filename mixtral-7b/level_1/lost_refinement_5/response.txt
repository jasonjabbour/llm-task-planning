Based on the initial state, the goal is to move the "baba\_obj" to the location of the "flag\_obj" which is at position (7, 4). However, in all of the previous attempts, the "baba\_obj" was moved down, which placed it at (7, 3), which is not the correct position. The correct position for the "baba\_obj" is (7, 4), which can be achieved by moving left from its current position (2, 5).

Here is the corrected action sequence that will result in winning the level:

```Python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up"]
```
explanation:
The first 6 "right" moves are to move the "baba\_obj" to the correct column (7), and the final "up" move is to move it to the correct row (4) to win the level.
