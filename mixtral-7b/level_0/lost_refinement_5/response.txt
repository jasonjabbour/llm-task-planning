Based on the previous action sequences, it seems that the AI agent is trying to move the "baba_obj" object towards the "flag_obj" object. However, it is not considering the "you_word" object and the "is_word" object, which seem to be important for winning the level.

In the initial state, the "you_word" object is located at (3, 8) and the "is_word" object is located at (7, 8), while the "baba_obj" object is located at (2, 4) and the "flag_obj" object is located at (7, 4). To win the level, we need to bring the "baba_obj" object onto the "flag_obj" object.

One possible action sequence that achieves this is:
```python
["up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "down", "right"]
```
Explanation:

1. Move the "baba_obj" object up to (2, 5) to step on the "is\_word" object. This is necessary because stepping on the "is\_word" object will make the "you\_word" object controllable.
2. Move the "you\_word" object up to (3, 5) by stepping on the "is\_word" object.
3. Move the "baba\_obj" object up to (2, 6) to make the "you\_word" object controllable.
4. Move the "you\_word" object up to (3, 6) by stepping on the "is\_word" object.
5. Move the "baba\_obj" object up to (2, 7) to make the "you\_word" object controllable.
6. Move the "you\_word" object up to (3, 7) by stepping on the "is\_word" object.
7. Move the "baba\_obj" object down to (2, 4) to step on the "empty" object.
8. Move the "you\_word" object right to (4, 4) by stepping on the "is\_word" object.

At this point, the "baba\_obj" object and the "you\_word" object are adjacent to the "flag\_obj" object, and we can move the "baba\_obj" object onto the "flag\_obj" object to win the level.

However, since the "baba\_obj" object was moved to (2, 4) in the action sequence, we need to make sure that the "you\_word" object comes back to (3, 8) to make the "flag\_word" object controllable. Therefore, the final action sequence should be:
```python
["up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "down", "right", "left", "left", "up"]
```
With this action sequence, the AI agent should be able to win the level.
