To win the level, we need to move the "baba_obj" to the "flag_obj" location which is at position (5, 5). First, we move the "baba_obj" up to avoid any obstacles, then move it to the left to reach the same row as the "flag_obj". After that, we move it right to reach the exact position of the "flag_obj".

Actions:
```Python
["up", "left", "left", "up", "up", "left", "left", "down", "down"]
```
explanation:

The given initial state has "baba_obj" at (2, 2) and "flag_obj" at (5, 5). We need to move "baba_obj" to (5, 5) by avoiding obstacles and moving only in the allowed directions (up, down, left, right).

1. Move up: From (2, 2), move up to (2, 3) to avoid hitting the rock at (3, 2).
2. Move left: From (2, 3), move left to (1, 3) and avoid the rock at (3, 3).
3. Move left: Move left again from (1, 3) to (1, 2) and avoid the 'rock_word' at (1, 1).
4. Move up: From (1, 2), move up to (1, 5) and avoid the 'rock_obj' at (3, 4) and (5, 3).
5. Move up: From (1, 5), move up to (1, 6) and avoid the 'border' at (1, 9).
6. Move left: From (1, 6), move left to (0, 6) and avoid the 'border' at (0, 9).
7. Move left: From (0, 6), move left to (0, 5) and avoid the 'border' at (0, 9).
8. Move down: From (0, 5), move down to (1, 5) and land on the 'flag_obj' at (5, 5).
9. Move down: Finally, from (1, 5), move down to (2, 5) since landing on the flag isn't immediate win in this case, and avoid the rock at (3, 5).

So, the result is:
```Python
["up", "left", "left", "up", "up", "left", "left", "down", "down"]
```
