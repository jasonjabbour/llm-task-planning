Based on the initial state, it seems like the 'baba\_obj' (short for babushka object) and the 'rock\_obj' objects are blocking the path to the 'flag\_obj' object, which is the goal of the level. Additionally, there are 'empty' spaces that can be used to move the 'baba\_obj' and 'rock\_obj' out of the way.

In the previous action sequences, it seems like the AI was trying to move the 'baba\_obj' towards the 'flag\_obj' by moving up and left. However, it did not account for the 'rock\_obj' that was blocking the path.

Therefore, a corrected action sequence would be:
```python
["right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right"]
```
Explanation:

1. Move 'baba\_obj' to the right: This action moves the 'baba\_obj' away from the 'rock\_obj' and creates an 'empty' space that can be used to move the 'rock\_obj' later.
2. Move 'baba\_obj' down: This action moves the 'baba\_obj' further away from the 'rock\_obj' and towards the flag.
3. Move 'baba\_obj' to the right: This action creates an 'empty' space next to the 'rock\_obj' so that it can be moved out of the way later.
4. Move 'baba\_obj' down: This action moves the 'baba\_obj' towards the flag.
5. Move 'baba\_obj' to the right: This action creates an 'empty' space next to the 'rock\_obj' so that it can be moved out of the way later.
6. Move 'baba\_obj' down: This action moves the 'baba\_obj' towards the flag.
7. Move 'baba\_obj' to the right: This action moves the 'baba\_obj' to the flag.

After these actions, the 'baba\_obj' will be next to the 'flag\_obj' and the 'rock\_obj' will be moved out of the way. This should allow the level to be won.
