Based on the initial state, it seems like the goal is to move the "baba\_obj" to the "flag\_obj" at position [5,5]. In the previous action sequences, it seems like the agent made errors in moving the "baba\_obj" towards the "flag\_obj". I have corrected the action sequence below to win the game:

```Python
["up", "up", "right", "right", "down", "down"]
```
Explanation:

1. First, move "baba\_obj" up two times to position [2,5]. This will avoid the rock at position [3,5].
2. Then, move "baba\_obj" right two times to position [4,5]. This will position "baba\_obj" at the same row as the "flag\_obj".
3. Finally, move "baba\_obj" down two times to position [5,5]. This will place "baba\_obj" on top of the "flag\_obj" and win the game!
