Based on the initial state, we can see that our goal is to move the 'baba\_obj' to the location of the 'flag\_obj' at (5, 5). I will provide a sequence of actions that will take 'baba\_obj' to the goal location by avoiding obstacles.

Previous actions have displayed some problematic patterns leading to returning to the previous positions. To avoid such cases, I'll provide a sequence that gets 'baba\_obj' to the flag in as fewest possible steps and avoiding repetition.

```Python
["up", "up", "up", "right", "right"]
```

Explanation:

In the initial state, 'baba\_obj' is already on the same row as the flag. We only need to move upwards, then move 2 steps right to reach the flag and win the game. It is crucial to avoid previous mistakes by not repeating actions that put 'baba\_obj' back into its previous positions. This sequence will allow 'baba\_obj' to directly arrive at the target location based on the provided initial state.
