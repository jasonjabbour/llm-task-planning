Based on the initial state and the history of previous actions, I can see that the goal is to move the "baba_obj" to the location of the "flag_obj" at [5, 5]. I also notice that there are "rock_obj" that we need to move out of the way. Here is a sequence of actions that should allow us to win the game:

```Python
["up", "right", "up", "right", "down", "down", "right", "up", "up", "right", "up", "up"]
```
Explanation:

1. First, move up to [2, 3] to get out of the way of the first "rock_obj" at [3, 4].
2. Move right to [3, 3] to be in position to push the "rock_obj"
3. Move down to [3, 4] to push the first "rock_obj" onto the empty space
4. Move down again to [3, 5] to be in position to move onto the "is_word" at [2, 8]
5. Move right to [4, 5] to be in position to push the second "rock_obj"
6. Move up twice to [2, 5] to push the second "rock_obj" onto the "is_word"
7. Move right to [3, 5] where the flag_obj is located.

Now the flag is captured and this should result in winning the game.
