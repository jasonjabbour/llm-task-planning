Based on the initial state and the history, it seems that the 'baba\_obj' or 'baba\_word' needs to be moved to the location of the 'flag\_word' which is at position [6, 8]. Also, the 'flag\_obj' needs to be moved to the location of the 'win\_word' which is at position [8, 8]. The previous actions sequence did not result in winning the game as it ended up moving the 'baba\_obj' to a position that was not the location of the 'flag\_word'.

Here is the corrected action sequence:
```Python
actions = ['up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down']
```
Explanation:
First, the 'baba\_obj' will be moved up twice to get to the same row as the 'flag\_word' which is at position [6, 8]. Then, it will be moved to the right 5 times to get to the position of the 'flag\_word'. After that, the 'flag\_obj' will be moved down 3 times to get to the location of the 'win\_word'.

With this sequence of actions, the 'baba\_obj' will be at the location of the 'flag\_word' and the 'flag\_obj' will be at the location of the 'win\_word', making it possible to win the game.
