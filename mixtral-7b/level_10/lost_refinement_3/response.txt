Based on the initial state, it seems that the 'baba\_obj' is on top of the 'goop\_obj' at position (2, 6). The objective is to move the 'baba\_obj' to the 'win\_word' at position (3, 7). 

In the previous actions, you first moved the 'baba\_obj' down, which was unnecessary because it didn't help in achieving the objective. Then, you moved it up, but that didn't make any change to the state because the 'baba\_obj' was already at position (2, 6).

To achieve the objective, we need to move the 'baba\_obj' 1 step to the right and then 1 step up. However, before moving it up, we need to remove the 'goop\_obj' under it by moving it down. Here is the action sequence:

```Python
["right", "down", "up"]
```

This sequence will move the 'baba\_obj' to the (3, 6) position, remove the 'goop\_obj' under it, and then move the 'baba\_obj' to the (3, 7) position, i.e., on the 'win\_word'. This should help in winning the game.
