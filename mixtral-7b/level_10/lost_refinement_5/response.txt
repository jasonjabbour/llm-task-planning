Based on the replay buffer for the previous action sequences, it seems that the game gets lost when the 'baba\_obj' object comes into contact with a 'goop\_obj' object. The 'goop\_obj' objects were initially located at the same position as the 'baba\_word' and 'win\_word' objects.

Therefore, the winning action sequence would involve moving the 'baba\_obj' object to the position of the 'win\_word' object, while avoiding the 'goop\_obj' objects.

Here's a possible action sequence to win the game:
```Python
["up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up"]
```
Explanation:

* Move the 'baba\_obj' object up to avoid the 'goop\_obj' object at the initial position of the 'baba\_word' object.
* Move the 'baba\_obj' object to the right, towards the 'win\_word' object.
* Move the 'baba\_obj' object up to avoid the 'goop\_obj' objects.
* Move the 'baba\_obj' object to the right, towards the 'win\_word' object.
* Move the 'baba\_obj' object up onto the 'win\_word' object to win the game.

Note that this action sequence assumes that the 'baba\_obj' object starts at the position of the 'baba\_word' object. If it does not, then the action sequence may need to be adjusted accordingly.
