Based on the initial state, the goal is to move the `baba_obj` to the `win_word` location at `[3, 7]`. However, in the previous attempts, the agent moved the `baba_obj` down first, which brought it closer to the `sink_word` at `[8, 2]`. To avoid this, the agent should move `baba_obj` up first.

Here's the corrected action sequence:

```Python
actions = ['up']
```

Explanation:

This action moves the `baba_obj` up to `[2, 7]`, away from the `sink_word` and closer to the `win_word`. In the next step, the agent can move `baba_obj` to the right to reach the goal.
