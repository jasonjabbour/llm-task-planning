Based on the initial state and the replay buffer of previous actions, it seems that the 'baba\_obj' is the object that we can control, and our goal is to reach the 'win\_word' located at [3, 7]. However, the 'goop\_obj' objects at certain locations will cause us to lose the game if we step on them.

In the previous actions, we can see that action 'right' caused the 'goop\_obj' to be removed, but that's because the 'baba\_obj' was also removed in the next state, so it's not an effective action in winning the game. The action sequence ['right', 'down', 'up'] led to losing the game because 'baba\_obj' stepped on the 'goop\_obj' at [3, 6].

To win the game, one possible action sequence is:

```Python
["up", "right", "up", "right", "up"]
```

Explanation:

First, move 'baba\_obj' upwards to [2, 6], avoiding the 'goop\_obj' at [3, 6].
Then, move 'baba\_obj' to the right at [3, 6], still avoiding the 'goop\_obj' at [3, 6].
Finally, move 'baba\_obj' upwards to reach the 'win\_word' at [3, 7].

This sequence avoids the 'goop\_obj' at [3, 6] and leads 'baba\_obj' to the 'win\_word' while making sure that the 'baba\_obj' never steps on the 'goop\_obj' at any point during the game.
