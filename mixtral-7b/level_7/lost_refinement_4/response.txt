Based on the initial state and the history of previous actions, it seems that the objective is to move the "baba\_obj" to the location of the "flag\_obj" while avoiding the "keke\_obj" and the "border". The "keke\_obj" is controlled by an adversarial agent that moves it towards the player. The player can only move in the four cardinal directions.

In previous attempts, the player has been trapped by the "keke\_obj" and lost the game. This has happened because the player has been moving in the same direction as the "keke\_obj" and has not been able to get out of its way.

To avoid this, the player should move in a direction that is perpendicular to the direction of the "keke\_obj". This will allow the player to get out of the way of the "keke\_obj" and reach the "flag\_obj".

One possible action sequence that follows this strategy is:

```python
["up", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right", "down", "right"]
```

This sequence of actions moves the player in a diagonal direction, which is perpendicular to the direction of the "keke\_obj" in the initial state. This should allow the player to avoid the "keke\_obj" and reach the "flag\_obj".

However, it is important to note that the position of the "keke\_obj" and the "baba\_word" may change in each episode, so the player should be prepared to adapt its strategy accordingly. For example, if the "keke\_obj" is moving in a direction that is parallel to the player's desired direction, the player should move in a different direction to avoid being trapped. Similarly, if the "baba\_word" is blocking the player's way, the player should find a different path to the "flag\_obj".

In summary, the player should move in a direction that is perpendicular to the direction of the "keke\_obj" and avoid the "baba\_word" and the "border" to reach the "flag\_obj". The player should be flexible and adapt its strategy based on the changing positions of the game objects.
