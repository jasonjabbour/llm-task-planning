Based on the history, I see that the agent made two attempts to win the game. In both attempts, the agent moved the 'baba_obj' object to the 'flag_obj' object by moving down and then right. However, the game was not won because the 'keke_obj' object was not moved to the 'flag_word' object.

Therefore, the agent needs to first move the 'keke_obj' object to the 'flag_word' object and then move the 'baba_obj' object to the 'flag_obj' object.

Here is the corrected action sequence that will result in winning the game:

```Python
["up", "right", "down", "down", "right", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "down", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right"]
```

explanation:

* Move up to reach the 'keke_word' object at (1, 7).
* Move right to reach the 'keke_obj' object at (3, 7).
* Move down to reach the 'is_word' object at (3, 5).
* Move down to reach the 'empty' space at (3, 4).
* Move right to reach the 'baba_word' object at (4, 7).
* Move down to reach the 'flag_obj' object at (5, 4).
* Move down to reach the 'flag_word' object at (6, 1).
* Move down to the 'empty' space at (7, 1).
* Move right to reach the 'win_word' object at (8, 1).

By following this sequence, the 'keke_obj' object will be moved to the 'flag_word' object at (6, 1), and then the 'baba_obj' object will be moved to the 'flag_obj' object at (5, 4), resulting in winning the game.
