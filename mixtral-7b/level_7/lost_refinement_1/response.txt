Based on the initial state and the history provided, it seems that the agent's objective is to move the "baba_obj" to the "flag_obj" location at (5, 4) and then move the "you_word" to the "win_word" location at (8, 1). However, the agent made a mistake in the previous actions by trying to move the "baba_obj" outside of the level, causing the game to be lost momentarily.

Here's the corrected action sequence:

```Python
["up", "left", "left", "left", "left", "down", "down", "down", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]
```

The agent should first move up to avoid moving the "baba_obj" outside of the level. After that, the agent should move left to position the "baba_obj" on top of the "flag_obj", then move down to finalize the flag capture and proceed to the right side of the level. In this sequence, the agent will avoid moving the "baba_obj" outside of the level while ensuring the flag capture and reaching the "win_word".
