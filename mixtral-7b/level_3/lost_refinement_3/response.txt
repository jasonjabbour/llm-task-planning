Based on the initial state, the objective is to move the `love_obj` to the location of the `flag_obj` which is currently at position (7, 6) and (8, 7) in the previous attempts. The `love_obj` is initially at position (7, 3) and the player can control it by the list of actions provided. 

From the history, it can be observed that moving the `flag_obj` one step to the right 4 times results in moving it closer to the end goal. However, it seems that the `love_obj` was not moved in the same direction simultaneously, which caused the failure of the previous attempts.

In the first attempt, the `flag_obj` was moved to position (8, 7) but the `love_obj` was left at position (7, 4), which is not the objective.

In the second attempt, the `flag_obj` was moved to position (8, 7) and then back to position (7, 7) but the `love_obj` was left at position (7, 5), which is still not the objective.

In the third attempt, the `flag_obj` was moved to position (8, 6) but the `love_obj` was left at position (8, 5), which is not the objective either.

Therefore, the corrected action sequence should be:

```Python
["up", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]
```

This will move the `flag_obj` from its initial position (7, 6) to (9, 6) and the `love_obj` from its initial position (7, 3) to (9, 3). At the same time, the player will not have any empty spaces between them and the border, which will help in winning the game.

Furthermore, it can be observed from the initial state that there are no obstacles between the `love_obj` and the `flag_obj` except for the `flag_obj` itself. Therefore, moving the `flag_obj` out of the way using the above action sequence, will make it possible for the `love_obj` to reach the objective, which is to reach the location of the `win_word`.
