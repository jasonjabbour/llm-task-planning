To win this level, we need to move the "love_obj" to the location of the "win_word". According to the given state, the "love_obj" is located at (7, 3) and the "win_word" is located at (3, 8). We can achieve this by moving "love_obj" up by 4 units and then moving it to the right by 4 units.

Here are the actions that we need to take:

```python
["up", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "right"]
```

Explanation:

* We move "love_obj" up by 4 units to reach the same row as the "win_word".
* We move "love_obj" to the right by 4 units to reach the same column as the "win_word".
