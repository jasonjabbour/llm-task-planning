Based on the initial state, the goal is to move the 'baba\_obj' to the location of 'win\_word' which is at position (2,4). The previous action sequences did not result in winning the game. In the first attempt, 'baba\_obj' was moved towards the right and downwards, reaching the position (8,1). However, this is not the correct direction. In the second attempt, 'baba\_obj' was moved upwards, but it exceeded the game board and the 'lost' condition was met. In the third attempt, 'baba\_obj' was moved leftwards, but it was still not close enough to the 'win\_word'.

Considering these previous attempts, it is clear that the correct direction to move 'baba\_obj' is upwards and then leftwards. Based on this, the following action sequence is suggested:

```Python
["up", "up", "left", "left", "left"]
```

This action sequence will move 'baba\_obj' upwards for 2 units and then leftwards for 3 units, reaching the position (2,4) which is the goal. This sequence should result in winning the game.
