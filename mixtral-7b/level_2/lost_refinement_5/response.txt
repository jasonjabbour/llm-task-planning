Based on the initial state and the history provided, it seems like the goal is to move the 'baba\_obj' object to the 'win\_word' location. The main reason for the previous attempts not succeeding is that they either move the object out of bounds (actions 1 and 5) or make it collide with another object (actions 2-4). Action 3 specifically makes the game lose since it collides the 'baba\_obj' object with the 'border'.

To avoid these problems, a safe approach is to find a path, step by step, using the available actions while checking if the target location is valid. Here's a revised action sequence that should help win the level:

```python
["up", "up", "up", "left", "left"]
```

Explanation:

This series of movements checks for the position of 'win\_word' [2, 4] and stops right above it at [5, 4]. Now, we can move 'baba\_obj' down and win the level.

1. ['up', 'up', 'up']: Move up three times to position at [5, 7].
2. ['left', 'left']: Move left twice to position at [5, 4].

From this position, the 'baba\_obj' will be directly above the 'win\_word' location. Now move 'baba\_obj' down:

3. ['down']: Move down to the 'win\_word' location at [5, 4] and win the level.
