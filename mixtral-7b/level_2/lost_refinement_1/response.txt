Based on the initial state, it is observed that the 'you_word' is located at (6, 7) and the 'win_word' is located at (2, 4). In the previous action sequence, the AI agent moved 'baba_obj' from (5, 4) to (8, 1), which led to a dead end.

To win the game, the AI agent should bring the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location at (2, 4). To do that, the AI agent should follow this corrected action sequence:

```Python
["up", "up", "up", "up", "left", "left", "left", "left", "left", "down", "down", "down"]
```

explanation:

In the corrected action sequence, the AI agent moves 'baba_obj' upwards from (8, 1) to (5, 4), then moves it to the left of 'win_word', reaching (2, 5). Then, it moves 'baba_obj' to (2, 4) by moving downwards once, winning the game.
