Based on the initial state, it seems that the goal is to move the 'baba\_obj' object to the 'win\_word' location at (2, 4). However, it's important to avoid moving 'baba\_obj' to any location that is part of the 'is\_word' list, since that would result in losing the game.

In the first sequence of previous actions, you initially moved 'baba\_obj' downwards, and then moved rightwards until reaching the edge of the grid. However, this approach did not lead to winning the game.

In the second sequence of previous actions, you initially moved 'baba\_obj' upwards until reaching the edge of the grid, then tried moving leftwards. However, by moving upwards, you caused the loss of the game, since (5, 8) is part of the 'is\_word' list.

To win the game, a safer approach would be to move 'baba\_obj' diagonally downwards until reaching the row containing the 'win\_word'. After that, move 'baba\_obj' leftwards towards the 'win\_word'.

Based on the given action space, here's the sequence of actions I suggest:
```Python
["down", "left", "left", "left", "left"]
```
Explanation:

Initially, move 'baba\_obj' diagonally downwards to reach the row that contains the 'win\_word'. Then, move 'baba\_obj' leftwards to reach the 'win\_word' location, making sure not to go over the 'is\_word' list.
