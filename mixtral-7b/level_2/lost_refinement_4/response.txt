Based on the replay buffer history, it seems that the AI made a mistake in the first sequence of actions by moving the "baba\_obj" onto the same space as the "win\_word". This caused the game to be lost. To win the game, the "baba\_obj" needs to be moved onto the "baba\_word" while avoiding the "win\_word".

Here is the corrected action sequence:

```Python
['up', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'left']
```

explanation:

The corrected sequence starts by moving the "baba\_obj" up 4 times and then left 4 times. This places the "baba\_obj" on top of the "baba\_word" without touching the "win\_word". The game should now be won.
