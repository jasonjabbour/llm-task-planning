Based on the previous action sequences, it seems like the agent is trying to move the "baba_obj" object towards the "flag_obj" object. However, it is important to avoid the "lava_obj" and "hot_word" objects, which can cause the game to be lost.

In the second previous actions sequence, the agent was able to move the "baba_obj" object to the same row as the "flag_obj" object. However, it then accidentally moved onto the "hot_word" object, which caused the game to be lost.

To avoid this outcome, the agent should prioritize moving towards the "flag_obj" object, but also pay attention to the locations of the "lava_obj" and "hot_word" objects. The "baba_word" objects can be ignored for now, as they do not pose any danger to the "baba_obj" object.

With this strategy in mind, a possible action sequence that can lead to winning the level is:

```Python
["left", "left", "up"]
```

explanation:

The agent should move left twice to avoid the "lava_obj" and "hot_word" objects. It can then move up towards the "flag_obj" object. There are no "lava_obj" or "hot_word" objects in the path of the "baba_obj" object, so the agent should be able to safely move towards the "flag_obj" object and win the game.
