Based on the initial state, we can see that the 'you\_word' is located at [3, 1], and the 'flag\_obj' is located at [4, 8]. In the history, we can see that trying to move 'baba\_obj' to the right multiple times led to a dead end. This is because moving 'baba\_obj' to the right will either make it fall into 'lava\_obj' or make it hit 'is\_word' located at [8, 4], neither of which will help us reach 'flag\_obj'. Instead, we can try moving 'baba\_obj' up and then left to reach 'flag\_obj'. Here's the action sequence to win the level:

```Python
["up", "left"]
```

Explanation:

In the initial state, 'baba\_obj' is located at [5, 4]. We need to move 'baba\_obj' up and then left to reach 'flag\_obj' located at [4, 8]. First, moving 'baba\_obj' up will take it to [5, 5]. Then, moving 'baba\_obj' left will take it to [4, 5]. From there, 'baba\_obj' can move left again and then down to reach the 'flag\_obj' at [4, 8] and win the level.
