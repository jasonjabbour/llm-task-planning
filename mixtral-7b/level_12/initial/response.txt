Based on the given state, it appears that the objective is to move the 'baba\_obj' to the location of the 'flag\_obj' at (4, 8) in order to win the level. We can determine the sequence of actions required to move the 'baba\_obj' to the 'flag\_obj' by calculating the direction to move it and then moving it in that direction.

The 'controllables' field in the state indicates that the 'baba\_obj' is the controllable object. The current location of the 'baba\_obj' is at (5, 4) and the location of the 'flag\_obj' is at (4, 8). To move from (5, 4) to (4, 8), we need to move the 'baba\_obj' up and to the left, which corresponds to the directions 'up' and 'left' in our action space.

Here is the sequence of actions required to move the 'baba\_obj' to the 'flag\_obj' and win the level:
```Python
["up", "left"]
```
We first move 'baba\_obj' up, and then move it to the left to reach the 'flag\_obj'.

Note: The state of the game may change after each action, and it is important to consider these changes in order to ensure that the sequence of actions will indeed result in winning the level. This response assumes that the only change in state after taking each action will be the movement of the 'baba\_obj' in the intended direction. If there are other factors that may influence the state of the game after each action, it may be necessary to revise the sequence of actions accordingly.
