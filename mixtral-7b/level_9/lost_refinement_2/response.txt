Based on the initial state and the history provided, it seems that the agent needs to avoid the skull objects, as interacting with them results in losing the game. The goal of the game is to raise the flag object and win the game.

In the first sequence of actions, the agent moved to the right four times, then moved down three times. This sequence of actions causes the agent to come in contact with a skull object, resulting in the loss.

In the second sequence of actions, the agent moves up twice, then left four times. This sequence of actions keeps the agent safely away from the skull objects. However, it fails to win the game since it doesn't reach the flag object.

Based on these observations, I propose a new sequence of actions that keep the agent safely away from the skull objects and reach the flag object to win the game:

```Python
["up", "left", "up", "left", "up", "left", "up"]
```

explanation:

The agent moves up and left in an alternating pattern to avoid the skull objects. The agent starts from the position of the 'baba_obj' at (2,5), and these actions move it towards the flag object located at (6,5). To ensure avoiding the 'skull_obj' which is located at (5,5), the agent moves up first, followed by moving left, effectively bypassing the skull object.
