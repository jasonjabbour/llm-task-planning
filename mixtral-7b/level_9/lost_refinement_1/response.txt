Based on the initial state and the history provided, it seems that the agent was trying to move the 'baba\_obj' to the right and down, but ended up moving into a 'skull\_obj' tile, causing the game to be lost. The correct sequence of actions would involve moving the 'baba\_obj' towards the 'flag\_obj' tile located at (6, 5), without moving into any 'skull\_obj' tiles.

Here's a possible sequence of actions that can lead the agent to win the game:

```Python
["up", "up", "left", "up", "up", "left", "left", "left"]
```

Explanation:

1. Move 'baba\_obj' up twice to avoid the 'skull\_obj' tiles located at (5, 5), (5, 4), and (5, 6).
2. Move 'baba\_obj' left to align it with the 'is\_word' and 'empty' tiles located at (2, 1) and (3, 1).
3. Move 'baba\_obj' up twice to avoid the 'skull\_obj' tiles located at (6, 4), (6, 5), and (6, 6).
4. Move 'baba\_obj' left three times to reach the 'flag\_obj' tile located at (6, 5).

By following these actions, the agent should win the game by stepping onto the 'flag\_obj' tile, while avoiding the 'skull\_obj' tiles.
