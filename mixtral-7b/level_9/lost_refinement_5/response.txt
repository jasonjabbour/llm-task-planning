Based on the initial state, the goal is to move the 'baba\_obj' to the 'flag\_obj' location at (6, 5) without hitting any 'skull\_obj'. In the previous action sequences, the agent moved 'baba\_obj' into a 'skull\_obj' location, causing the game to be lost.

To avoid this, the agent can follow this action sequence:

```Python

["up", "up", "left", "up", "left", "up", "left", "up", "left"]

```

Explanation:

1. Move 'baba\_obj' up to (2, 7) and then left to (1, 7) to avoid the 'skull\_word' at (1, 8) and reach the 'is\_word' at (2, 7).
2. Move 'baba\_obj' up to (1, 8), left to (1, 9), and then up to (1, 10) to navigate safely around the 'is\_word' at (2, 7).
3. Move 'baba\_obj' left to (0, 10) and then up to (0, 11) to reach the 'you\_word' at (3, 1).
4. Move 'baba\_obj' left to (-1, 11) and then up to (-1, 12) to navigate safely around the 'you\_word' at (3, 1).
5. Move 'baba\_obj' up to (-1, 13) and then left to (-2, 13) to reach the 'win\_word' at (6, 1).
6. Finally, move 'baba\_obj' up to (6, 14), left to (6, 13), up to (6, 14), and then left again to reach the 'flag\_obj' at (6, 5), which will win the game.

This sequence avoids all 'skull\_obj' and moves 'baba\_obj' to the 'flag\_obj' to win.
