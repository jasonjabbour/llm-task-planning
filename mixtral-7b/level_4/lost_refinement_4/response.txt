Based on the initial state, it seems that the goal is to move the 'baba\_obj' to the 'win\_word' location at (8, 8). However, the previous action sequences didn't take into account the obstacles on the way such as the 'rock\_obj' at (7, 5). 

In order to win the level, the AI needs to navigate the 'baba\_obj' around the obstacles by first moving up and then moving left. Here are the corrected action sequences:

```Python
["up", "left"]
```

explanation:

The first action moves the 'baba\_obj' up from (2, 5) to (2, 6) and the second action moves it left from (2, 6) to (1, 6), which is one step away from the 'rock\_obj'. This way, the AI avoids the obstacle and can continue to navigate the 'baba\_obj' towards the 'win\_word' location.
