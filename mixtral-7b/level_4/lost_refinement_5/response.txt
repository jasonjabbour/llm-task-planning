Based on the provided history, it seems like the AI agent was trying to move the 'baba_obj' towards the 'rock_obj' to push it out of the way. However, it overshot and ended up going down too far, as seen in Previous Actions 1. The agent then tried a few other actions, but none of them led to winning the game.

To win the game, the 'baba_obj' needs to reach the 'win_word' object at position [8, 8]. Considering the current state and the past attempts, the following sequence of actions should lead to success:

```Python
["right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:

First, move the 'baba_obj' 3 steps to the right to be at the same x-coordinate as the 'rock_obj'. Then, move upwards, away from the 'rock_obj' so that it doesn't push it back. After passing the 'rock_obj', move further upwards until reaching the 'win_word' at position [8, 8].
