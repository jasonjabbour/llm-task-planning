Based on the initial state, we can see that our objective is to move the 'baba\_obj' to the 'win\_word' location at (8, 8). However, in the previous action sequences, the agent moved the 'baba\_obj' to the 'rock\_obj' location and then tried to move down, which caused the game to stop because baba cannot move through rocks.

To correct this, the agent should move the 'baba\_obj' to the right, up, or left to avoid the 'rock\_obj', and then move up to reach the 'win\_word'. Here's an example of a corrected action sequence:

```Python
["right", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:

First, move 'baba\_obj' to the right to avoid the 'rock\_obj'. Then, move up twice to reach the 'win\_word' location at (8, 8). This way, we can win the game without getting stuck.
