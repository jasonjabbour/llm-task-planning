Based on the initial state, it seems that the 'baba_obj' is one position away from the 'rock_obj'. However, the 'baba_obj' can only push the 'rock_obj' when they are in the same row or column. Therefore, the 'baba_obj' needs to move down to be in the same row as the 'rock_obj'. Also, the 'rock_obj' is currently blocking the path to the 'flag_word', which is the goal. 

However, in the previous attempts, the 'baba_obj' was moved to the right, but this did not help in achieving the goal. So, let's try moving it down to be in the same row as the 'rock_obj' and then push the 'rock_obj' towards the left.

Here is the action sequence to achieve this:

```Python
["down", "left"]
```

explanation:

1. Move 'baba_obj' down to be in the same row as the 'rock_obj'.
2. Push the 'rock_obj' towards the left to clear the path to the 'flag_word'.
3. Move to the 'flag_word' and win the level.
