Based on the initial state and the history provided, it appears that the previous action sequences were trying to move the 'baba_obj' towards the 'rock_obj' to push it out of the way. However, they didn't consider that if the 'baba_obj' moves down too much, it will fall off the edge of the game area (as the 'rock_obj' did in the history).

To win the game, we need to push the 'rock_obj' to the left, clear a path for 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word', and then move 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word'. Here's the corrected action sequence:

```Python
actions = ['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']
```

The first part of the sequence moves 'baba_obj' to the right to push the 'rock_obj' out of the way. Then, 'baba_obj' moves up a bit to avoid falling off the edge when pushing the 'rock_obj'. After pushing the 'rock_obj' to the left, we clear a path by moving 'baba_obj' down. Finally, 'baba_obj' moves to the 'win_word'.

Explanation:

1. Move 'baba_obj' to the right to push the 'rock_obj' and clear the path to move down.
2. Move 'baba_obj' down a bit but not too much to avoid falling off the edge when pushing 'rock_obj'.
3. Move 'baba_obj' to the right to push the 'rock_obj' to the left.
4. Move 'baba_obj' up a little to avoid falling off the edge.
5. Move 'baba_obj' to the right to clear the path after pushing 'rock_obj'.
6. Move 'baba_obj' down to go under the pushed 'rock_obj'.
7-18. Move 'baba_obj' to the right to reach and stand on the 'win_word' and win the game.

To find the optimized shorter action sequence, you could improve this solution by using more advanced pathfinding techniques, like A\* or Dijkstra's algorithm.
