To determine the correct sequence of actions to win the level, let's analyze the initial state and the history of previous actions and their replay buffers.

The goal is to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location, which is at [[8, 1]].

From the history, we can observe that moving 'baba_obj' to the right and then down gets it closer to the 'win_word' location.

However, we also notice that simply moving down does not always result in a change in the state, which means there might be obstacles or boundaries that prevent the 'baba_obj' from moving further down.

Looking at the initial state, we see that there is a 'wall_obj' at [[1, 6], [2, 6], [3, 6], [4, 6], [5, 6], [6, 6], [7, 6], [8, 6]], which could be blocking the path to the 'win_word' location.

To overcome this obstacle, we need to find a way to move the 'baba_obj' around the 'wall_obj' and reach the 'win_word' location.

Based on this analysis, the corrected action sequence is:

```python
["right", "right", "right", "down", "down", "down", "left", "left", "down", "right"]
```

Explanation:
This sequence moves the 'baba_obj' to the right, avoiding the 'wall_obj', and then down to reach the 'win_word' location. The 'left' and 'right' actions are used to navigate around the 'wall_obj' and ensure that the 'baba_obj' reaches the correct location.

Note: The actual sequence may vary depending on the specific game mechanics and rules, which are not fully specified in the problem description. However, based on the provided history and initial state, this sequence seems like a reasonable attempt to reach the 'win_word' location.
