To develop a winning strategy for this level, we must first analyze the initial state and the history of previous actions. The goal is to reach the 'win_word' object located at [[8, 1]] with the 'baba_obj' which is initially at [[5, 4]].


Given the initial state and the history of previous actions, it seems the previous strategy of moving 'up' four times did not yield the desired outcome of winning the game. This is because the 'baba_obj' is blocked by the 'wall_obj' at [[1, 6], [2, 6], [3, 6], [4, 6], [5, 6], [6, 6], [7, 6], [8, 6]], which prevents it from reaching the 'win_word'.


The 'baba_obj' needs to navigate around the 'wall_obj' to reach the 'win_word'. Given the layout, the 'baba_obj' must first move to the right to avoid the 'wall_obj', then move down to reach the 'win_word'.


Here is a corrected action sequence that should result in winning the level:


```python
["right", "right", "down", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right"]
```


Explanation:
This sequence moves the 'baba_obj' to the right, avoiding the 'wall_obj', then down towards the 'win_word'. Since the 'win_word' is at [[8, 1]], the 'baba_obj' needs to navigate down and then to the right to reach it. The exact sequence may need adjustments based on the game's specific movement rules and how objects interact, but the general approach of avoiding the 'wall_obj' by moving right and then down towards the 'win_word' should be correct.
