To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj' location. Based on the provided history and state, we can see that the 'baba_obj' is initially located at [[5, 4]] and the 'flag_obj' is located at [[5, 8]]. 

We also need to consider the 'win_word' location at [[8, 1]], which is likely to be the final goal. 

However, to reach the 'win_word', we first need to get to the 'flag_obj' by moving the 'baba_obj' up to the 'flag_obj' location. 

After analyzing the history and the state, we can see that moving the 'baba_obj' to the right and then up would be a possible solution. 

Here's the corrected action sequence:

```python
["right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right"]
```

This sequence moves the 'baba_obj' to the right, and then up to the 'flag_obj' location, and finally to the 'win_word' location, which should result in winning the level. 

Please note that the provided history and state do not give a clear indication of the winning conditions, so this is an educated guess based on the available information. 

Also, note that this sequence might need to be adjusted based on the actual game mechanics and the rules of the game, which are not fully specified in the provided information. 

It is also worth noting that the provided history shows that moving the 'baba_obj' to the right and then down does not lead to the 'win_word' location, so we need to try a different approach. 

The provided utils with the directions can be used to calculate the new position of the 'baba_obj' after each move, which can help in planning the sequence of actions. 

Finally, it is worth mentioning that the 'lost' and 'won' conditions in the state can be used to determine if the game is won or lost after each action, which can help in adjusting the sequence of actions accordingly.
