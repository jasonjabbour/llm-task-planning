To win the level, we need to guide the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj'. The 'baba_obj' is initially located at [5, 4] and the 'flag_obj' is located at [5, 8]. Since the 'baba_obj' is controllable, we can move it to the 'flag_obj' by moving it up four times.

Here is the list of actions that need to be taken to win the level:

```python
["up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:
The 'baba_obj' is initially located at [5, 4]. We need to move it to the 'flag_obj' which is located at [5, 8]. To do this, we can simply move the 'baba_obj' up four times. This will guide the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj' and win the level. The 'up' action is used because it moves the 'baba_obj' in the positive y-direction, which is the direction towards the 'flag_obj'. 

Note: The actual winning condition may involve additional steps or rules not specified in the given information, but based on the provided state and action space, the above sequence of actions should move the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj'.
