To determine the correct sequence of actions to win the level, let's analyze the given state and the history of previous actions and their outcomes. The goal is to reach the 'win_word' located at [8, 1] with the 'baba_obj' starting at [5, 4].

```Python
["right", "right", "right", "down", "down", "down", "down"]
```

Explanation:

1. **Understanding the State**: The initial state shows the 'baba_obj' at position [5, 4] and the 'win_word' at [8, 1]. The goal is to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location.

2. **Analyzing Previous Actions**: 
   - The first set of actions moved 'baba_obj' up but didn't result in winning.
   - The second set of actions moved 'baba_obj' to the right and then down, but again didn't result in a win.
   - The third set of actions moved 'baba_obj' further to the right and then down, similar to the second attempt but without the initial right movements.
   - The fourth set of actions involved moving 'baba_obj' to the right and then up, which doesn't seem to align with reaching the 'win_word' location.

3. **Determining the Correct Path**: 
   - Since 'win_word' is located at [8, 1], we need to move 'baba_obj' from [5, 4] to [8, 1].
   - This requires moving 'baba_obj' 3 steps to the right (to reach the x-coordinate of 8) and then 3 steps down (to reach the y-coordinate of 1).

4. **Action Sequence**: Based on the analysis, the sequence should involve moving 'baba_obj' to the right three times and then down four times to align with the 'win_word' position at [8, 1].

This sequence is designed to navigate 'baba_obj' from its starting position to the location of 'win_word', thus achieving a win condition for the level.
