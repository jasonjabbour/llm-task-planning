To determine the correct sequence of actions to win the level, we need to analyze the initial state, the action space, and the history of previous actions and their corresponding replay buffers.

The goal is to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location. Based on the initial state and the history, we can see that the 'baba_obj' is initially located at [[5, 4]] and the 'win_word' is located at [[8, 1]].

From the history, we can see that moving 'up' four times does not lead to any changes in the state, and moving 'right' and 'down' leads to some changes in the state, but does not reach the 'win_word' location.

To reach the 'win_word' location, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the right and down. Based on the 'directions' in the utils, we can see that moving 'right' corresponds to [1, 0] and moving 'down' corresponds to [0, -1].

Here is the corrected action sequence:

```python
["right", "right", "right", "down", "down", "down"]
```

This sequence moves the 'baba_obj' to the right three times to reach the x-coordinate of the 'win_word' location, and then moves it down three times to reach the y-coordinate of the 'win_word' location.

This sequence should lead to winning the level because it moves the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location, which is the goal of the level.
