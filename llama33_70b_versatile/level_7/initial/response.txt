To win the level, the goal is to reach the 'win_word' object, which is located at [8, 1]. The controllables list is empty, implying that the agent can move in any of the four directions (up, down, left, right) but does not have a specific object to control.

Since the 'keke_obj' and 'baba_obj' are close to the border and to the 'flag_obj', and considering the 'win_word' is at [8, 1], we need to navigate through the empty spaces and other objects to reach the 'win_word'.

Given the current state, the 'baba_obj' is at [3, 4] and the 'flag_obj' is at [5, 4]. The 'win_word' is at [8, 1], so we should navigate from the 'baba_obj' location towards the 'win_word' location.

One possible approach would be to move the 'baba_obj' or any controllable object towards the 'win_word'. However, since the 'controllables' list is empty, we will assume that we are controlling the 'baba_obj'. 

To do this, we would first move down to [3, 3], then down to [3, 2], and then down to [3, 1]. Then we can move right to [4, 1], [5, 1], [6, 1], [7, 1], and finally [8, 1], which is the location of the 'win_word'.

Here are the actions to achieve this:

```python
["down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]
```

Explanation:
This sequence of actions moves the object from [3, 4] down to [3, 1] and then to the right until it reaches [8, 1], where the 'win_word' is located. Note that this solution assumes that there are no obstacles that can prevent the object from moving in the specified direction. Also, the emptiness of the 'controllables' list is assumed to be an oversight, and the movement of objects is based on the assumption that some form of object can be controlled. The actual actions might differ based on the actual game mechanics and rules.
