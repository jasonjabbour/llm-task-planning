To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location. Based on the initial state and the history of previous actions, we can see that the 'baba_obj' is initially at location [[2, 5]]. The 'win_word' is located at [[8, 8]]. 

The previous actions show that moving down four times and then right six times will move the 'baba_obj' to [[8, 2]]. Then, moving up three times will move the 'baba_obj' to [[8, 5]]. However, this is not the correct location.

To reach the 'win_word' location, we need to move the 'baba_obj' up three more times. 

Here is the corrected action sequence:

```python
["down", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

This sequence will move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location, which is [[8, 8]]. This should result in winning the level. 

Note: This solution assumes that there are no other obstacles or objects that can block the 'baba_obj' from reaching the 'win_word' location. If there are any obstacles, additional actions may be needed to move them out of the way.
