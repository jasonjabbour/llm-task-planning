To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location at [8, 8]. 

The initial state shows that 'baba_obj' is at [2, 5] and 'win_word' is at [8, 8]. To move 'baba_obj' to 'win_word', we need to move down to y-coordinate 2, then move right to x-coordinate 8, and finally move up to y-coordinate 8.

Based on the previous actions and their corresponding replay buffers, we can see that moving down three times and then moving right six times will bring 'baba_obj' to [8, 2]. Then, moving up six times will bring 'baba_obj' to [8, 8], which is the location of 'win_word'.

Here is the corrected action sequence:

```python
["down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

This sequence will move 'baba_obj' from [2, 5] to [8, 8], which is the location of 'win_word', thus winning the level.
