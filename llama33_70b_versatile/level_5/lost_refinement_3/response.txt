To solve this level, we need to understand the current state, the goal, and the history of previous attempts. The goal is to reach the 'win_word' location at [[8, 8]]. Given the history of previous actions and their outcomes, we should identify a path that avoids obstacles and leads 'baba_obj' to the win condition.

Analyzing the history:
- Previous Actions 1 and 2 show a pattern of moving down and then right, trying to navigate through the level but not reaching the win condition. 
- Previous Actions 3 attempts a different approach, moving down, then right, and up, but still doesn't achieve the win condition.

Considering the current state and the action space ['up', 'down', 'left', 'right'], a successful strategy would involve navigating 'baba_obj' from its initial position [[2, 5]] to the 'win_word' location at [[8, 8]]. Given the obstacle locations and the movements allowed, a viable path would be to move 'baba_obj' down to reach the lower part of the level, then move right to approach the 'win_word', and finally move up to reach the 'win_word' location.

Here is a proposed sequence of actions based on the analysis:

```python
["down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:
This sequence is designed to navigate 'baba_obj' down to the lower part of the level, avoiding obstacles, then move right until it is directly below the 'win_word', and finally move up to reach the 'win_word' location. The number of 'up' actions at the end is adjusted to ensure 'baba_obj' reaches the correct y-coordinate of the 'win_word'. This approach takes into account the lessons learned from previous attempts and aims to provide a direct path to the win condition while avoiding obstacles.
