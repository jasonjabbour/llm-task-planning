To solve this level, we need to analyze the state and the history of previous actions. The goal is to reach the 'win_word' object located at [[8, 8]]. 

From the initial state, we can see that the 'baba_obj' is located at [[2, 5]]. We need to move it to the right and up to reach the 'win_word'. 

The history of previous actions shows that moving down and then right can help us navigate through the level. However, we also need to consider the 'rock_obj' and 'flag_obj' that can affect our path.

Here is the corrected action sequence:

```python
["down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:
This action sequence starts by moving the 'baba_obj' down to avoid the 'rock_word' at [[2, 3]]. Then, it moves right to navigate through the level. After reaching the rightmost part of the level, it moves up to reach the 'win_word' at [[8, 8]]. The additional 'up' actions ensure that the 'baba_obj' reaches the 'win_word' without being blocked by any obstacles. 

Note that this action sequence is based on the analysis of the initial state and the history of previous actions. It may need to be adjusted if the level layout or the object locations change.
