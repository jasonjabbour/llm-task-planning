To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location. The 'baba_obj' is initially located at [2, 5] and the 'win_word' is located at [8, 8]. We can use the 'controllables' information to determine that we can move the 'baba_obj'.

First, we need to move the 'baba_obj' down to the bottom of the grid, then move it right to the rightmost column, and finally move it up to the 'win_word' location.

Here's the action sequence:

```python
["down", "down", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:
The provided action sequence is the most straightforward path to the 'win_word' location. We start by moving down to the bottom of the grid, then we move right to the rightmost column, and finally, we move up to the 'win_word' location. This path avoids any obstacles and ensures that we reach the 'win_word' location in the fewest number of steps. 

The initial location of 'baba_obj' is [2, 5]. To reach [8, 8], we first move down 5 steps to [2, 0], then we move right 6 steps to [8, 0], and finally, we move up 8 steps to [8, 8]. This path does not account for potential collisions with other objects that may be present in the grid. For a more accurate and robust solution, additional information about the environment, such as potential obstacles or collision rules, would be necessary. 

However, considering the action space provided and the given utilities, the proposed action sequence provides a viable path to the 'win_word' location under the assumption that no collisions occur.
