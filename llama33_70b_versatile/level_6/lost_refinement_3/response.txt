To solve this level, we need to navigate the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location at [8, 8]. 

From the initial state, we can see that the 'baba_obj' is at [2, 2] and the 'win_word' is at [8, 8]. We also notice that there are 'rock_obj' and 'flag_obj' that could potentially block our path.

Looking at the previous actions and their replay buffers, we can see that the 'baba_obj' can move right and up to avoid the 'rock_obj' and 'flag_obj'. 

The corrected action sequence would be to move right to [8, 2], then up to [8, 8]. 

Here is the corrected action sequence:

```python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

This sequence will move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location, thus winning the level.

Explanation:
The provided sequence moves the 'baba_obj' to the right until it reaches the x-coordinate of the 'win_word', then moves up until it reaches the y-coordinate of the 'win_word'. This sequence avoids the 'rock_obj' and 'flag_obj' by moving around them. 

Note: The actual sequence might vary based on the specific rules of the game and how the objects interact with each other. The provided sequence is based on the information given in the problem and the previous actions and their replay buffers.
