To win the level, we need to reach the 'win_word' location at [[8, 8]]. The 'baba_obj' is initially at [[2, 2]]. We need to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location.

```python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up"]
```

Explanation:
The previous actions and their corresponding replay buffers show the movement of the 'baba_obj' in different directions. However, none of them reach the 'win_word' location. 

To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the right until it reaches the right border, then move it up until it reaches the top border, and finally move it right again to reach the 'win_word' location.

The corrected action sequence starts by moving the 'baba_obj' to the right until it reaches the right border. Then, it moves up until it reaches the top border. However, moving up six times does not reach the 'win_word' location. 

So, the corrected action sequence moves the 'baba_obj' to the right six times, then up six times, and then right and up alternatingly until it reaches the 'win_word' location. This sequence of actions should result in winning the level. 

Note that this is a simple pathfinding problem, and the solution assumes that there are no obstacles or other objects that can block the 'baba_obj' from reaching the 'win_word' location. In a real game scenario, you would need to consider these factors and adjust the action sequence accordingly.
