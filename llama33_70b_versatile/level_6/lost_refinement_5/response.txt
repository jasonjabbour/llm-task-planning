To solve this level, we need to analyze the given state and the history of previous actions. The goal is to reach the 'win_word' object at position [8, 8]. 

From the initial state, we can see that the 'baba_obj' is at position [2, 2]. We need to move it to the right to reach the 'win_word'. However, there are 'rock_obj' objects in the way that we need to avoid.

From the history of previous actions, we can see that moving the 'baba_obj' up when it is at position [5, 2] will result in it being blocked by a 'rock_obj'. Therefore, we need to find a way to move the 'baba_obj' around the 'rock_obj' objects.

Here is the corrected action sequence:

```python
["right", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up"]
```

This sequence of actions moves the 'baba_obj' to the right, avoiding the 'rock_obj' objects and eventually reaching the 'win_word' object at position [8, 8]. The 'up' actions are used to move the 'baba_obj' up when it is at the correct x-position, and the 'right' actions are used to move it to the right.

Note: This sequence of actions is based on the given state and the history of previous actions. It may not work for all possible states or levels. 

Explanation:
- Start by moving the 'baba_obj' to the right to reach the 'win_word'.
- Use 'up' actions to move the 'baba_obj' up when it is at the correct x-position.
- Avoid 'rock_obj' objects by moving the 'baba_obj' around them.
- Continue moving the 'baba_obj' to the right and up until it reaches the 'win_word' object at position [8, 8].
