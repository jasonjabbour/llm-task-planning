To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj' location. Based on the initial state and the history of previous actions, we can see that the 'baba_obj' is initially at location [[2, 2]] and the 'flag_obj' is at location [[5, 5]]. 

We will move the 'baba_obj' right until it reaches the column of the 'flag_obj', then move it up to reach the row of the 'flag_obj'.

```python
["right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up"]
```

This sequence of actions will move the 'baba_obj' to the location [[5, 5]], which is the location of the 'flag_obj', thereby winning the level. 

Note that we don't need to move the 'baba_obj' down because it is already at a lower row than the 'flag_obj'. Also, we don't need to move it left because we are moving it right to reach the column of the 'flag_obj'. 

After reaching the column of the 'flag_obj', we move it up to reach the row of the 'flag_obj', which is at row 5. 

This is the corrected action sequence that will result in winning the level.
