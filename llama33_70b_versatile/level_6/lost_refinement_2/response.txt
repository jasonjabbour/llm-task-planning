To solve this level and reach the 'win_word' object at location [8, 8], we need to carefully plan the sequence of actions, taking into account the obstacles like 'rock_obj' and the controllable object 'baba_obj'. The key insight here is to avoid pushing the rocks into positions that would block our path to the goal and to utilize the empty spaces effectively.

Given the initial state and the history of previous actions, we notice that moving the 'baba_obj' directly to the right and then up towards the goal is hindered by the rocks. The previous attempts show us how moving the 'baba_obj' right and then up results in it getting stuck or blocked by the rocks.

To successfully reach the 'win_word', we should aim to navigate through the empty spaces in a way that avoids the rocks and other obstacles. Given the layout and the goal, the strategy should involve navigating around the rocks by moving left, right, up, or down to avoid direct collision with them.

Here is a proposed solution based on the analysis:

```python
["right", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right"]
```

Explanation:
This sequence of actions is designed to move the 'baba_obj' around the rocks and other obstacles towards the 'win_word' at [8, 8]. The strategy involves moving right when possible to advance towards the goal and moving up to avoid rocks and utilize the vertical empty spaces. By carefully planning each move, we aim to navigate the 'baba_obj' through the maze-like environment without getting blocked, ultimately reaching the 'win_word' and winning the level. 

Note: This solution assumes that the environment's rules and the objects' behaviors remain consistent with the provided history and initial state. Adjustments may be necessary based on the actual game mechanics and any unforeseen interactions.
