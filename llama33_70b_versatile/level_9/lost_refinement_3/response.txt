To win the level, we need to navigate the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj' while avoiding the 'skull_obj'. Based on the history of previous actions and their corresponding replay buffers, we can see that the 'baba_obj' can move in the 'up', 'down', 'left', and 'right' directions.

From the initial state, the 'baba_obj' is located at [[2, 5]]. The 'flag_obj' is located at [[6, 5]]. We need to move the 'baba_obj' to the right and then down to reach the 'flag_obj'.

Here is the corrected action sequence that will result in winning the level:

```python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "down", "down", "down", "down"]
```

Explanation:
This sequence moves the 'baba_obj' to the right until it is below the 'skull_obj', and then moves it down to the 'flag_obj'. This sequence avoids the 'skull_obj' and successfully reaches the 'flag_obj', which should result in winning the level. 

Note: This solution assumes that there are no other objects or constraints in the level that are not mentioned in the initial state or history. If there are additional objects or constraints, the solution may need to be adjusted accordingly. 

Also, note that this is a simplified solution based on the given information and may not work in all cases. A more robust solution would require a more detailed analysis of the level and its constraints. 

In this case, since we want the baba_obj to reach the flag_obj which is at [6,5] and baba_obj is at [2,5], we can simply move it to the right 4 times. 

```python
["right", "right", "right", "right"]
```

Explanation:
This sequence moves the 'baba_obj' to the right 4 times, which will place it at the same location as the 'flag_obj', resulting in winning the level. 

So the final answer is:

```python
["right", "right", "right", "right"]
```
