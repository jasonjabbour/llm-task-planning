To determine the correct sequence of actions to win the level, we first need to understand the game's objective and the current state. The goal appears to be reaching the 'flag_obj' or the area that leads to winning the game without encountering 'skull_obj' or other losing conditions.

Given the initial state and the history of previous actions, it's clear that moving directly towards the 'skull_obj' results in losing the game. Therefore, the strategy should involve avoiding 'skull_obj' and navigating through 'empty' spaces towards the 'flag_obj' or 'win_word'.

Considering the 'baba_obj' starts at [[2, 5]] and the goal is to reach the 'flag_obj' at [[6, 5]] without touching the 'skull_obj', a viable path seems to go around the 'skull_obj' by moving down and then right, avoiding direct contact with the 'skull_obj'.

Here's a proposed sequence of actions:

```python
["down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "down", "right"]
```

Explanation:
- Start by moving down to create some space and avoid the immediate 'skull_word' and 'kill_word' areas.
- Then move right, aiming to bypass the 'skull_obj' cluster by going under it.
- Continue moving right to align with the 'flag_obj' horizontally.
- Finally, move down to reach the 'flag_obj' or the 'win_word' area, ensuring to avoid any losing conditions like 'skull_obj'.

This sequence aims to safely navigate the 'baba_obj' around obstacles and towards the winning condition, utilizing the 'empty' spaces as a path. Adjustments might be necessary based on the exact game mechanics and rules not fully detailed in the provided information.
