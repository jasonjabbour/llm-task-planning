To win the level, we need to guide the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj' while avoiding the 'skull_obj'. Based on the provided history and replay buffer, we can see that moving the 'baba_obj' directly to the right results in a loss due to the presence of 'skull_obj'. We need to find an alternative path.

Upon analyzing the initial state, we notice that there is a possible path downwards from the initial position of the 'baba_obj'. We can move down, then right, and continue downwards to reach the 'flag_obj'.

Here is the corrected action sequence:

```python
["down", "down", "right", "down", "down", "right", "right", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right"]
```

Explanation:
This action sequence moves the 'baba_obj' down from its initial position, then right, and continues downwards to avoid the 'skull_obj'. It then moves right and down to reach the 'flag_obj', ultimately winning the level. This sequence takes into account the initial state and the positions of the 'skull_obj' and 'flag_obj', providing a safe path for the 'baba_obj' to follow.
