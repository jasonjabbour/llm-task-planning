To solve this level, we need to understand the initial state and the history of previous actions. The goal is to find a sequence of actions that leads to winning the game. 

The initial state provides the location of various objects, including the controllable objects 'love_obj' and 'flag_obj', and their initial positions. 

From the history of previous actions, we can observe the changes in the state after each action. However, we don't see a clear winning condition or a clear path to the goal in the given history.

Let's analyze the objects and their possible movements. The 'love_obj' and 'flag_obj' can be moved up, down, left, or right. The goal is likely to move these objects to a specific location, possibly the 'win_word' or 'flag_word' locations.

Since we don't have enough information about the winning condition, let's assume that the goal is to move the 'love_obj' to the 'win_word' location.

Based on the initial state, the 'love_obj' is at location [2, 3] and the 'win_word' is at locations [3, 8] and [3, 1]. To move the 'love_obj' to the 'win_word' location, we need to move it right and up.

Here is a possible sequence of actions:

```python
["right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

This sequence of actions will move the 'love_obj' to the right and up, potentially reaching the 'win_word' location. However, this is just an educated guess, and the actual sequence of actions may vary depending on the game's rules and winning conditions.

Note that the history of previous actions does not provide a clear solution to the problem, and the correct sequence of actions may require additional information about the game's rules and objectives.
