To win the level, we need to navigate the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj' location. Based on the initial state and the history of previous attempts, we can analyze the movements and their effects on the environment.


The goal is to reach the 'flag_obj' at location [6, 7] from the initial location of 'baba_obj' at [6, 4]. Since the 'baba_obj' can only move in the 'controllables' list, we can plan the actions as follows:


First, move 'baba_obj' up to reach the empty space at [6, 5], then move right to reach the 'flag_obj' at [6, 7] but since there is a wall, we must move around it.


However, given the actions provided in the history, we see that moving down from the initial position of 'baba_obj' makes more sense as it creates a path that can potentially lead to the 'flag_obj' by navigating around the wall.


We also notice that the 'wall_word' and 'stop_word' do not provide a direct path to the flag, so our best approach would be to go around the wall.


Given the provided history, we can see that going down and then moving right could create a path for 'baba_obj' to reach the flag.


Here is a potential list of actions:


```python
["down", "down", "right", "right", "up", "up", "right"]
```


Explanation:

The provided sequence of actions starts by moving 'baba_obj' down twice to create space and then moves it to the right twice to navigate around the wall. Then it moves up twice and then right to reach the flag.


This sequence is based on the analysis of the environment and the movements of 'baba_obj' in the history. It takes into account the obstacles in the environment, such as the 'wall_word' and the 'stop_word', and tries to navigate around them to reach the 'flag_obj'. The 'utils' provided also helps in understanding the directions and movements in the environment.
