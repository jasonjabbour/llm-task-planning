To solve this level, we need to guide the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj' while avoiding obstacles and utilizing the provided action space effectively.

Given the initial state and the history of previous actions, we observe that the goal is to reach the 'flag_obj' located at [6, 7]. The 'baba_obj' is initially at [6, 4], and there are 'wall_obj' and 'is_word' objects that could potentially block the path or have an effect based on the words present in the game environment.

```python
["right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up", "right", "up"]
```

Explanation:
The provided action sequence aims to navigate the 'baba_obj' around the obstacles to reach the 'flag_obj'. Starting from [6, 4], moving "right" places the 'baba_obj' at [7, 4], then moving "up" to [7, 5], and continuing this pattern to avoid the 'wall_obj' and other objects that could hinder progress. The sequence continues to move "right" and "up" to navigate through the grid, leveraging the given action space to overcome the challenges presented by the level's layout and object placement. 

This sequence is designed to ensure that the 'baba_obj' reaches the 'flag_obj' without getting stuck or triggering a loss condition, thereby achieving the level's objective. The specific movements are chosen to maximize the use of the available space and to navigate around obstacles effectively, based on the game's logic and the objects' interactions as inferred from the provided information.
