To win the level, the goal is to reach the 'win_word' object located at [8, 1]. Based on the initial state and the history of previous actions, it seems that the 'baba_obj' can move around and potentially reach the 'win_word'. However, the previous actions did not result in winning the game, so a new approach is needed.


After analyzing the initial state and the history of previous actions, I noticed that the 'baba_obj' can move down and right to reach the 'win_word'. However, the 'wall_obj' and 'stop_word' objects are blocking the way, and the 'baba_obj' needs to navigate around them.


Here is the corrected action sequence:


```python
["down", "down", "right", "right", "up", "right", "down", "right", "up", "right", "down"]
```


This action sequence will move the 'baba_obj' down to avoid the 'wall_obj', then right to reach the 'win_word'. The 'up' actions are used to navigate around the 'stop_word' object. The final 'down' and 'right' actions will move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' object, winning the game.


Note that this action sequence is based on the initial state and the history of previous actions, and it may not work if the state of the game changes. Additionally, this is just one possible solution, and there may be other action sequences that can also win the game.
