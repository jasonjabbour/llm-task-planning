To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the location of the 'flag_obj'. Based on the initial state, the 'baba_obj' is located at [2, 6] and the 'flag_obj' is located at [7, 7]. 

Since the 'baba_obj' can only be controlled to move in the four main directions (up, down, left, right), we need to find a sequence of moves that will move the 'baba_obj' to the location of the 'flag_obj' without hitting any obstacles or getting stuck.

The 'baba_obj' needs to move right 5 units and up 1 unit to reach the location of the 'flag_obj'. 

Here is the sequence of actions that will result in winning the level:

```Python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up"]
```

Explanation:
The 'baba_obj' is initially located at [2, 6]. To move it to the location of the 'flag_obj' at [7, 7], we need to move it 5 units to the right and 1 unit up. The sequence of actions ["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up"] will achieve this, resulting in the 'baba_obj' reaching the location of the 'flag_obj' and winning the level. 

Note: This sequence of actions assumes that there are no obstacles or other objects that can block the movement of the 'baba_obj'. If there are obstacles, a more complex sequence of actions would be required to navigate around them.
