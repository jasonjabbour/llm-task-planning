To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given state and the history of previous actions and their outcomes. The goal is to find a sequence of actions that will lead to winning the level.

The initial state shows the location of various objects, including 'baba_obj', 'flag_obj', and 'win_word'. The 'baba_obj' is located at [2, 6] and is controllable. The 'win_word' is located at [3, 7], and the 'flag_obj' is at [7, 7].

From the history, we can see that moving 'baba_obj' to the right or down often results in losing the game, as it gets removed from the state. This suggests that we need to be careful with our movements and avoid certain areas.

One possible approach is to move 'baba_obj' up to reach the 'win_word' location. However, we need to avoid moving it to the right, as this has resulted in losing the game in the past.

Here is a possible sequence of actions that could lead to winning the level:

```python
["up", "up", "right", "up", "up"]
```

This sequence moves 'baba_obj' up to the 'win_word' location while avoiding the areas that have resulted in losing the game in the past.

Explanation:
The provided sequence of actions aims to move 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location while minimizing the risk of losing the game. By moving 'baba_obj' up and then to the right, we can potentially reach the 'win_word' location and win the level. However, this sequence is speculative and may require further adjustments based on the actual gameplay mechanics and the outcomes of each action. 

Note that the sequence of actions is based on the analysis of the initial state and the history of previous actions. The actual outcome of the game may vary depending on the specific rules and behavior of the game. 

To further improve the sequence of actions, we would need to consider additional factors, such as the movement of other objects in the game and any potential obstacles or challenges that may arise during gameplay. 

Also, note that the sequence of actions provided is just one possible solution and may not be the only or optimal solution to win the level. Further analysis and experimentation may be necessary to find the most effective sequence of actions. 

Let me know if I should continue to explore different options.
