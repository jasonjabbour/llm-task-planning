To determine the correct action sequence to win the level, let's analyze the given information. The goal is to navigate the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location. 

From the initial state, the 'baba_obj' is located at [2, 6] and the 'win_word' is located at [3, 7]. The 'baba_obj' is a controllable object.

The HISTORY section shows a previous attempt where the 'baba_obj' moved to the right five times and then up, resulting in a loss. This attempt removed the 'baba_obj' from the controllable list and resulted in a loss.

Given the 'baba_obj' location and the 'win_word' location, a more suitable approach would be to move the 'baba_obj' down to reach the 'win_word'. 

However, looking at the initial state and the history of the previous attempt, the initial attempt did not give us information about how the 'baba_obj' can be moved to the 'win_word' location.


```python
["down", "right", "up"]
```

Explanation:

The corrected action sequence starts by moving the 'baba_obj' down to avoid obstacles and then moving right to get closer to the 'win_word'. However, since the initial 'baba_obj' location is [2, 6] and the 'win_word' is at [3, 7], moving down would put the 'baba_obj' at a position [2, 5] which seems to have a 'goop_obj'. Therefore, the first action "down" might need to be adjusted based on the specific rules of the game that are not provided in the problem statement. After that, moving up is needed to reach the 'win_word'.


This solution assumes that the 'baba_obj' can move down and then right and finally up to reach the 'win_word'. However, this is based on limited information. For a more accurate solution, we would need to know the exact rules and how the objects interact in the game.
