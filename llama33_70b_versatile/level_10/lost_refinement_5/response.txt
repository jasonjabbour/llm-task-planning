To solve this level, we first need to understand the objective and the state of the game. The goal is to reach the 'win_word' object, which is located at position [3, 7], without getting stuck or losing the game.

From the initial state, we see that the 'baba_obj' is located at [2, 6]. To move it towards the 'win_word', we need to go down to [2, 5], then right to [3, 5], and finally up to [3, 6] and then left to [2, 6] is not a viable path as seen in previous attempts. Then, going up from [2, 5] or [3, 5] to reach [2, 7] or [3, 7] directly might be a possible approach but given the 'goop_obj' at [3, 6], it would be better to try to avoid this path.

However, looking at the previous attempts and the changes in the replay buffer, we see that going right from the starting position results in losing the game because the 'baba_obj' gets removed when it touches the 'goop_obj'. The initial state also shows 'you_word' at [3, 8], 'win_word' at [3, 7], and 'flag_word' at [1, 7], which could potentially create a path for the 'baba_obj' if we manage to move the 'goop_obj' out of the way or create a path around it.

Considering the objective and the failed attempts, a better strategy might be to try and move the 'baba_obj' down and then right, but given the constraints and the layout of the 'goop_obj', a more viable approach seems to move down, navigate around the 'goop_obj', and then head towards the 'win_word'. However, without a clear path to move the 'goop_obj' and with the 'baba_obj' being the only controllable object, we have to rely on the movements that don't result in immediate loss.

A possible corrected action sequence, given the constraints and objectives, is to try and move around the 'goop_obj' by going down and then navigating towards the 'win_word' without directly interacting with the 'goop_obj' that causes loss when the 'baba_obj' touches it.

```python
["down", "right", "down", "right", "up", "right", "up"]
```

Explanation:
This sequence attempts to move the 'baba_obj' down to avoid the initial 'goop_obj', then right to start moving towards the 'win_word', down again to navigate around the 'goop_obj', and then up to reach the level of the 'win_word'. The exact sequence might need adjustments based on the game's specific mechanics and how the 'baba_obj' interacts with other objects in the environment, especially considering the 'goop_obj' and the 'flag_word' and 'you_word' which could potentially be used to create a path or avoid obstacles. Given the constraints and the goal, this sequence aims to find a path around the obstacles to reach the 'win_word' without losing the game.
