To determine the correct sequence of actions to win the level, we need to analyze the given state and the history of previous attempts. The goal is to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location without getting stuck or lost.

From the initial state, we can see that the 'baba_obj' is located at [2, 6] and the 'win_word' is at [3, 7]. The 'goop_obj' is scattered around the board, and we need to avoid getting stuck in it.

Looking at the history of previous attempts, we can see that moving 'right' four times and then 'up' results in losing the game. This suggests that moving too far to the right is not a good strategy.

The second attempt involves moving 'down', then 'right', and finally 'up'. This attempt also results in losing the game, which suggests that moving down and then right is not a good strategy either.

However, we can see that moving 'down' initially does move the 'baba_obj' to [2, 5], which is closer to the 'win_word'. Then, instead of moving 'right', we could try moving 'up' to move the 'baba_obj' to [2, 6] and then 'right' to move it to [3, 6]. From there, we can move 'up' to reach the 'win_word' at [3, 7].

Here is the corrected action sequence:

```python
["down", "up", "right", "up"]
```

This sequence of actions should allow the 'baba_obj' to move from its initial location to the 'win_word' location without getting stuck or lost. The 'down' action moves the 'baba_obj' to [2, 5], the 'up' action moves it back to [2, 6], the 'right' action moves it to [3, 6], and the final 'up' action moves it to the 'win_word' location at [3, 7].
