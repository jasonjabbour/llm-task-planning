To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location at [8, 8]. Based on the initial state and the history of previous actions, we can see that moving the 'baba_obj' to the right and then up will get us closer to the goal. However, simply moving up from the current location of the 'baba_obj' at [2, 5] will not work because there are obstacles in the way.

Upon analyzing the previous actions and their effects, we can see that moving the 'baba_obj' to the right and then up will allow us to bypass some of the obstacles. However, the previous actions got stuck at [8, 7] because there is no 'right' action to move the 'baba_obj' to [8, 8].

Here is the corrected action sequence that should win the level:

```python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "right"]
```

This sequence will move the 'baba_obj' to the right, bypassing some obstacles, and then up to reach the 'win_word' location at [8, 8]. The final 'right' action will move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location, winning the level.

Note: The above actions are based on the assumption that the 'baba_obj' can move in the specified directions and that the obstacles and goals do not change during the execution of the actions.
