To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location. Based on the initial state and the history of previous actions, we can see that the 'baba_obj' is initially located at [[2, 5]] and the 'win_word' is located at [[8, 8]]. We also notice that there is a 'rock_obj' at [[7, 5]] which can be removed by moving the 'baba_obj' to its location.

From the history of previous actions, we can see that moving the 'baba_obj' to the right and then up is a possible way to reach the 'win_word' location. However, we need to make sure that we avoid the 'rock_obj' and move it out of the way first.

Here is the corrected action sequence:

```python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "right", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:
The action sequence starts by moving the 'baba_obj' to the right until it reaches the 'rock_obj' location. Then, it moves up to remove the 'rock_obj' and create a path to the 'win_word' location. Finally, it moves up and right to reach the 'win_word' location and win the level.

Note that this action sequence is based on the initial state and the history of previous actions, and it may not be the optimal solution. However, it is a possible way to win the level based on the given information.
