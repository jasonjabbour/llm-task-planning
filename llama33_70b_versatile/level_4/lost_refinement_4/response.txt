To solve this level, we need to guide the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location. Based on the initial state and the history of previous actions, we can see that the 'baba_obj' is initially located at [[2, 5]] and the 'win_word' is located at [[8, 8]]. 

From the history, we can observe that the 'baba_obj' can move right and up to reach the 'win_word' location. However, there are obstacles like 'rock_obj' that need to be avoided. 

The correct sequence of actions would be to move the 'baba_obj' right until it reaches the column where the 'win_word' is located, and then move it up until it reaches the 'win_word'. 

Based on the initial state, the 'baba_obj' is located at [[2, 5]] and the 'win_word' is located at [[8, 8]]. We need to move the 'baba_obj' right 6 times to reach the column where the 'win_word' is located, and then move it up 3 times to reach the 'win_word'. 

However, from the history, we can see that when the 'baba_obj' moves up, the 'rock_obj' is removed from the next state. Therefore, we need to move the 'baba_obj' up before moving it right to avoid the 'rock_obj'.

Here is the corrected action sequence:

```python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:
This sequence of actions will guide the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location, avoiding the 'rock_obj' obstacle. The 'baba_obj' will first move right 6 times to reach the column where the 'win_word' is located, and then move it up 3 times to reach the 'win_word', thus winning the level. 

Note: The above solution assumes that the 'baba_obj' can move up and right without any restrictions, and that the 'rock_obj' is removed when the 'baba_obj' moves up. If there are any other restrictions or obstacles, the solution may need to be adjusted accordingly. 

However, upon closer inspection of the 'HISTORY' section, we see that in the provided sequences of actions, the 'baba_obj' was able to move up and right without any restrictions, and the 'rock_obj' was removed when the 'baba_obj' moved up. 

Therefore, we can conclude that the corrected action sequence provided above should guide the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location and win the level.
