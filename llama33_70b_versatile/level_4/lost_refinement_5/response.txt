To win the level, we need to guide the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location at [[8, 8]]. 

Looking at the initial state and the replay buffers from the previous actions, we can see that the 'baba_obj' can be moved right and up to reach the 'win_word' location. 

However, the 'rock_obj' at [[7, 5]] is blocking the path. We can remove the 'rock_obj' by moving the 'baba_obj' to the right of the 'rock_obj' and then moving up.

Here is the corrected action sequence:

```python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "right", "up", "up", "right", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:

This action sequence first moves the 'baba_obj' to the right of the 'rock_obj', then moves up to remove the 'rock_obj', and finally moves up and right to reach the 'win_word' location. This sequence should result in winning the level. 

Note that the sequence is based on the observations from the previous actions and the initial state, and it may need to be adjusted if the level layout or the object behaviors change.
