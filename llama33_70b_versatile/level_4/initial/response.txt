To solve this level, we need to navigate the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location. The 'baba_obj' is initially at position [2, 5] and the 'win_word' is at position [8, 8]. We can control the 'baba_obj' and move it up, down, left, or right.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Move 'baba_obj' to the right**: The 'baba_obj' needs to move to the right to reach the 'win_word'. We can move it right until it reaches the column where the 'win_word' is located.
2. **Move 'baba_obj' up**: Once the 'baba_obj' is in the correct column, we need to move it up to reach the row where the 'win_word' is located.
3. **Avoid obstacles**: We need to avoid any obstacles like 'rock_obj' and other objects that might be in the way.

### Action Sequence

```python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up"]
```

### Explanation

This action sequence will move the 'baba_obj' to the right until it reaches the column where the 'win_word' is located, and then move it up until it reaches the row where the 'win_word' is located. This sequence assumes that there are no obstacles in the way and that the 'baba_obj' can move freely. The 'baba_obj' will successfully reach the 'win_word' location, resulting in a win.

Note: The actual path may vary depending on the game's rules and any potential obstacles that may be present in the game. This solution is based on the given state and action space.
