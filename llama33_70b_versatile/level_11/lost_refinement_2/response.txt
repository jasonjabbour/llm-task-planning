To solve this level, we need to analyze the state and the history of previous actions. The goal is to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location without getting lost.

From the initial state, we can see that the 'baba_obj' is at location [2, 6] and the 'win_word' is at location [3, 7]. 

Looking at the history of previous actions, we can see that moving 'right' or 'down' and then 'right' results in losing the game. 

So, we need to find a different path to the 'win_word'. 

We can move 'up' to get to the 'you_word' location, and then move 'right' to get to the 'win_word' location.

Here is the corrected action sequence:

```python
["up", "right"]
```

This action sequence moves the 'baba_obj' up to the 'you_word' location and then right to the 'win_word' location, avoiding the 'goop_obj' and other obstacles that could result in losing the game.

Note: This solution is based on the given state and history of previous actions. The actual solution may vary depending on the specific game mechanics and rules. 

Also, the 'utils' dictionary provides the directions for each action, which can be used to calculate the new location of the 'baba_obj' after each action.

It's worth noting that this is a simple solution and may not work in all cases. A more robust solution would involve using a pathfinding algorithm, such as A* or BFS, to find the shortest path to the 'win_word' location while avoiding obstacles.
