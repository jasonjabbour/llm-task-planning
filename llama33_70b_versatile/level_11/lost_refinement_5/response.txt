To solve this level, we need to navigate the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj' while avoiding the 'goop_obj' and other obstacles. Based on the provided history and replay buffer, it seems that moving the 'baba_obj' to the right or down will cause it to lose the game.

Here is my proposed solution:

```python
["up", "up", "left", "left"]
```

Explanation:
In the initial state, the 'baba_obj' is located at [2, 6]. The goal is to move it to the 'flag_obj' located at [7, 7]. However, there are 'goop_obj' in the way, and moving down or right will cause the 'baba_obj' to lose the game.

My solution starts by moving the 'baba_obj' up twice to get to the position [2, 8]. Then, it moves left twice to get to the position [0, 8]. From there, the 'baba_obj' can potentially move down to the 'flag_obj' without encountering any obstacles. However, this is just the beginning of the solution, and further actions will be needed to actually reach the 'flag_obj'.

Note: The actual solution may require more steps and may involve avoiding 'goop_obj' and other obstacles. The provided history and replay buffer suggest that the correct solution will involve avoiding moving down or right, at least initially. Further exploration and analysis of the level may be necessary to determine the complete correct solution.
