To solve this level, we must carefully examine the initial state and the history of previous actions to understand the environment and the objectives. 

The initial state provides us with the locations of various objects, words, and the controllable entity ('baba_obj'). Our goal is to find a sequence of actions that will lead to winning the game, indicated by reaching the 'win_word' location at [3, 7] without losing, which is determined by avoiding harmful interactions or states.

Given the history, the previous actions ['right', 'up'] led to a loss because moving 'baba_obj' to the right resulted in it entering a space that led to a lost state. This suggests we must avoid such moves that rapidly lead to a lost state.

Upon examining the initial state, we notice that 'baba_obj' is located at [2, 6]. To reach the 'win_word' at [3, 7], we must move 'baba_obj' down to [2, 5] or another accessible path that does not immediately lead to a lost state. However, given the 'goop_obj' locations and other obstacles, we need to find a safe path.

Considering the directions provided in the utils and the need to avoid immediate lost states, a potential strategy involves moving 'baba_obj' in a way that navigates around 'goop_obj' and other hazards while making progress towards the 'win_word'.

Here is a potential corrected action sequence:

```python
["down", "right", "up"]
```

Explanation:
This sequence starts with moving down to [2, 5], then moves right to [3, 5], and finally moves up towards [3, 6] and then [3, 7] to reach the 'win_word'. However, given the constraints and the initial state, this might not directly lead to the 'win_word' without considering the movement of other objects or words. 

A more precise sequence, taking into account the need to navigate around obstacles and the 'goop_obj' locations, might involve additional steps or a different approach. Given the complexity and the initial failure, the exact path to victory will depend on accurately interpreting the game's rules, the movements of 'baba_obj', and how other objects ('goop_obj', 'flag_obj', 'rock_obj') interact with the environment and the controllable entity.

Since the provided sequence is a simplified guess and may not directly solve the level due to the potential interactions with 'goop_obj' and the requirement for 'baba_obj' to reach 'win_word' without causing a lost state, further analysis of the game's logic and object interactions is necessary to provide a definitive solution. 

For instance, a more detailed approach might consider the following steps:
1. Analyze the grid layout and the starting positions of all objects.
2. Identify potential paths for 'baba_obj' to reach 'win_word' while avoiding 'goop_obj' and other hazards.
3. Determine if any obstacles can be moved or if there are specific sequences that allow 'baba_obj' to pass through or around them safely.
4. Consider the effect of each action on the state of the game, ensuring that 'lost' remains False.

Given these considerations, the actual solution may involve a more complex sequence of actions, taking into account the game's specific rules and object interactions not fully captured in the initial analysis.
