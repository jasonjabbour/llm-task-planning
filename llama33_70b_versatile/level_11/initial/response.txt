To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the location of the 'win_word' which is at [[3, 7]]. The 'baba_obj' is initially at [[2, 6]]. 

The steps to achieve this are as follows:

1. Move the 'baba_obj' right to [[3, 6]].
2. Move the 'baba_obj' up to [[3, 7]].

Since the 'baba_obj' can only be controlled and the goal is to move it to the 'win_word' location, we need to find a path that avoids obstacles like 'goop_obj' and other objects that could prevent 'baba_obj' from reaching the 'win_word'. 

Given the initial state, the 'baba_obj' is not blocked by any obstacles when moving right and then up to the 'win_word' location. 

Therefore, the action sequence to win the level is:

```python
["right", "up"]
```

Explanation:
This sequence allows the 'baba_obj' to move from its initial location at [[2, 6]] to the 'win_word' location at [[3, 7]], which will result in winning the level. The 'right' action moves the 'baba_obj' to [[3, 6]] and then the 'up' action moves it to [[3, 7]].
