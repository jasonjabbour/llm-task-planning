To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location. The 'baba_obj' is initially at location [2, 6] and the 'win_word' is at location [3, 7]. 

Since 'baba_obj' can only move up, down, left, or right, we can move it up to reach the 'win_word'. However, there is a 'goop_obj' at location [3, 6] that is blocking the path. We can move the 'baba_obj' down to [2, 5] and then right to [3, 5] to avoid the 'goop_obj'. Then we can move up to [3, 6] and finally right to [3, 7] to reach the 'win_word'. But according to the history, moving right will result in a loss.

However, if we can move the 'goop_obj' away from the path, we can move the 'baba_obj' up to [3, 7]. Looking at the history, moving down and then right does not move the 'goop_obj' away. Moving up does not change anything.

Looking at the initial state, there is a 'push_word' at location [4, 1]. If we can move the 'baba_obj' to this location, we might be able to push the 'goop_obj' away.

Here is the sequence of actions to win the game:

```python
["down", "down", "right", "right", "up", "up", "right", "up"]
```

Explanation:
This sequence of actions first moves the 'baba_obj' down to [2, 4] and then right to [3, 4] and [4, 4]. Then it moves up to [4, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7] and right to [4, 7] and then up to [3, 7]. However this will not work as there is a 'goop_obj' at location [3, 6].

We should reconsider the path and find another way. The 'baba_obj' should move to the 'push_word' and then try to push the 'goop_obj'. 

Let's think about this level in a different way. If the 'baba_obj' moves to the 'push_word', it will be able to push the 'goop_obj'. 

Here is the corrected sequence of actions to win the game:

```python
["down", "down", "right", "right", "down", "right", "up", "up"]
```

This will move the 'baba_obj' down to [2, 4], right to [3, 4] and [4, 4], down to [4, 3], right to [4, 2] and [5, 2], then up to [5, 3], [5, 4], [5, 5], [5, 6], [5, 7], [5, 8]. Then it will move to [4, 8], [3, 8], [2, 8], [1, 8]. Then it will move down to [1, 7] which is not the 'win_word'. This is not the correct sequence.

Another possible sequence of actions to win the game:

```python
["down", "right", "right", "up", "right", "up"]
```

This sequence will move the 'baba_obj' down to [2, 5], right to [3, 5], right to [4, 5], up to [4, 6], right to [4, 7] and then up to [3, 7] which is next to the 'win_word'. Then it should move left to [2, 7] and down to [2, 6], right to [3, 6] and up to [3, 7].

Here is the corrected sequence of actions to win the game:

```python
["down", "right", "right", "up", "right", "up", "left", "down", "right", "up"]
```

This will move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word'. 

However, according to the history, this sequence will result in a loss. 

The correct sequence of actions to win the game is not straightforward and needs to be thought through carefully. It needs more information about the level and how it changes after each action. 

One more possible sequence of actions:

```python
["right", "up", "left", "up", "right"]
```

But this will also result in a loss.

Let's re-examine the history. In the first history, moving right results in a loss. In the second history, moving right and then up results in a loss. In the third history, moving up and then right results in a loss.

Therefore, the correct sequence of actions to win the game is:

```python
["down", "right"]
```

But this is not the full sequence. The 'baba_obj' needs to move up to the 'win_word'. So the correct sequence is:

```python
["down", "right", "up", "right", "up"]
```

But this will also result in a loss. 

Since we cannot move right, we need to move left. But moving left will not move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word'. We can move down and then left. But this will also not move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word'.

Looking at the initial state, we can see that the 'baba_obj' is at location [2, 6] and the 'win_word' is at location [3, 7]. We can move the 'baba_obj' down to [2, 5] and then left to [1, 5]. Then we can move up to [1, 6], [1, 7] and right to [2, 7], [3, 7].

Here is the corrected sequence of actions to win the game:

```python
["down", "left", "up", "up", "right", "right"]
```

Explanation:
This sequence of actions first moves the 'baba_obj' down to [2, 5], then left to [1, 5]. Then it moves up to [1, 6], [1, 7] and right to [2, 7], [3, 7]. This sequence of actions should move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word'.
