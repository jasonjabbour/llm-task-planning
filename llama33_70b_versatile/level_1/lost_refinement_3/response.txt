To win the level, we need to get the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location. Based on the initial state and the history of previous actions, we can see that the 'baba_obj' can move right and up to reach the 'win_word' location.

```python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

The explanation is as follows: 

1. The 'baba_obj' starts at location [2, 4]. 
2. We move the 'baba_obj' to the right 6 times to get it to location [8, 4]. This is because the 'win_word' is located at [8, 8] and we need to move up to get there. 
3. Then we move the 'baba_obj' up 5 times to get it to location [8, 8], which is the location of the 'win_word'. 

This sequence of actions should result in winning the level. The history of previous actions shows that moving right and up can get the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location, but the 'baba_obj' needs to move up one more time to actually reach the 'win_word'. 

The provided sequence of actions takes into account the movement of the 'baba_obj' and the location of the 'win_word', and should result in winning the level. 

The correction made from the previous actions is adding one more 'up' action to the sequence to get the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location. 

This sequence assumes that there are no obstacles or other objects that can block the 'baba_obj' from moving to the 'win_word' location. If there are any obstacles, the sequence of actions may need to be adjusted accordingly.
