To solve this level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the location of the 'win_word' which is at [[8, 8]]. 
The 'baba_obj' is initially located at [[2, 4]]. 
To get to the 'win_word', we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the right until it reaches the column where the 'win_word' is located, then we need to move it up until it reaches the row where the 'win_word' is located.

Here is the corrected action sequence:

```python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

This sequence first moves the 'baba_obj' to the right until it reaches the column where the 'win_word' is located, then it moves the 'baba_obj' up until it reaches the row where the 'win_word' is located. 

This action sequence will result in winning the level because it moves the 'baba_obj' to the location of the 'win_word'. 

The previous action sequences did not win the level because they did not move the 'baba_obj' to the correct location. 

The provided replay buffers show that moving the 'baba_obj' to the right and up will move it to the correct location, but the previous sequences did not move it far enough up. 

The corrected sequence moves the 'baba_obj' up 6 times after moving it to the correct column, which will move it to the row where the 'win_word' is located.
