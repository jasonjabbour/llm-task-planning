To solve this level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location. Based on the initial state and the history of previous actions, we can see that the 'baba_obj' can be moved right until it reaches the 'flag_obj' location, and then it can be moved up to reach the 'win_word' location.

However, in the previous actions, the 'baba_obj' was moved up only 4 times, which was not enough to reach the 'win_word' location. We need to move the 'baba_obj' up 5 times to reach the 'win_word' location at [8, 8].

Here is the corrected action sequence:

```python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:
The 'baba_obj' starts at location [2, 4]. We move it right 6 times to reach location [8, 4]. Then, we move it up 5 times to reach location [8, 8], which is the 'win_word' location. This should win the level. 

Note: The missing 'up' in the previous actions were added to this new sequence. 

Also note that, we used the `directions` utils to get the correct movements. The 'right' action moves the 'baba_obj' to the right, and the 'up' action moves it up. The number of 'right' and 'up' actions are based on the initial state and the 'win_word' location. 

In the previous actions, the 'baba_obj' was moved right 6 times and up 4 times. However, this was not enough to reach the 'win_word' location. The corrected action sequence moves the 'baba_obj' right 6 times and up 5 times, which should be enough to reach the 'win_word' location and win the level.
