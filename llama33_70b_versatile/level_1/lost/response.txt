To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location. The 'baba_obj' is currently at position [2, 4] and the 'win_word' is at position [8, 8]. 

We need to move the 'baba_obj' 6 steps to the right and 4 steps up to reach the 'win_word'. 

Here are the actions to win the level:

```python

["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up"]

```

Explanation:
The 'baba_obj' is the only controllable object in the game, and the goal is to move it to the 'win_word' location to win the game. Since the 'baba_obj' is currently at position [2, 4], we need to move it 6 steps to the right to reach the x-coordinate of the 'win_word', and then move it 4 steps up to reach the y-coordinate of the 'win_word'. This sequence of actions will result in winning the level. 

Note that the actual implementation might need to consider obstacles and other objects in the game, but based on the provided state and action space, this sequence should lead to a win. 

Also, note that in the given state, there is a 'flag_obj' at position [7, 4] and a 'flag_word' at position [6, 5], but these do not seem to affect the movement of the 'baba_obj' or the win condition. Similarly, the 'you_word' and 'is_word' seem to be unrelated to the movement of the 'baba_obj' or the win condition. 

Therefore, the provided sequence of actions should be sufficient to win the level.
