To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location. Based on the initial state and the history of previous actions, we can see that we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the right and then up to reach the 'win_word' location.

Here is the corrected action sequence:

```Python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:
In the initial state, the 'baba_obj' is located at [[2, 4]]. The 'win_word' is located at [[8, 8]]. To move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location, we need to move it to the right 6 times to reach the x-coordinate of 8. Then, we need to move it up 4 times to reach the y-coordinate of 8. This sequence of actions will result in winning the level.

Note: The 'flag_obj' is removed when the 'baba_obj' moves to the right of it, but this does not affect the goal of reaching the 'win_word' location. 

Also, the replay buffer from the previous actions shows the changes in the state after each action, which helps to understand how the actions affect the game state. 

However, upon reviewing the problem more carefully and looking at the initial state and the target location of the win word, the action sequence should be:

```Python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```
is not sufficient to reach the target. The sequence needs to take into account that the target is at [8,8] and we need to move up 4 steps after reaching [8,4]. But before that we also need to consider the steps to reach [8,4] which would require 6 steps to the right. 

However we also see in the initial state that 'baba_obj' is initially at [2,4] so to get to [8,4] it will actually take 6 steps to the right. 

So the sequence of actions is:
```Python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```
We move 6 steps to the right and then we move up 4 steps which gives us the following sequence of 10 steps. 

This should move the baba object from the start position [2,4] to the target position [8,8].
