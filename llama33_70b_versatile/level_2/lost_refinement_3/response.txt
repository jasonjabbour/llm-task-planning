To determine the correct action sequence to win the level, let's first analyze the given information and the history of previous attempts.

From the initial state, we see that the controllable object 'baba_obj' is at position [5, 4], and the goal is to reach the 'win_word' at position [2, 4].

Looking at the history of previous actions and their replay buffers, we can observe that the actions taken were moving the 'baba_obj' down, then left, and then up to try and reach the 'win_word'. However, in all previous attempts, the 'baba_obj' moved past the 'win_word' and did not stop at the correct position.

The main issue in the previous attempts is that the 'baba_obj' kept moving up after reaching the 'win_word' position, causing it to move past the goal.

To correct this, we need to stop the 'baba_obj' at the correct position. Since the 'win_word' is at position [2, 4], we should move the 'baba_obj' down, then left, and then up until we reach the position [2, 4], and then stop.

Here is the corrected action sequence:

```python
['down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'up', 'up']
```

Explanation:
This action sequence moves the 'baba_obj' down to position [5, 2], then left to position [2, 2], and then up to position [2, 4], which is the position of the 'win_word'. By stopping at this position, we should be able to win the level. 

Note that we removed the extra 'up' actions that were causing the 'baba_obj' to move past the goal in the previous attempts.
