To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location. From the initial state and the history of previous actions, we can see that we need to move 'baba_obj' from its initial location [[5, 4]] to the location [[2, 4]] where 'win_word' is.

The previous actions show that moving down twice, then left three times, and then up three times gets 'baba_obj' to the location [[2, 5]], but this is not the correct location. The correct location is [[2, 4]]. 

So, we need to adjust our actions. Instead of moving up three times, we should move up only twice to get 'baba_obj' to the location [[2, 4]].


```python
["down", "down", "left", "left", "left", "up", "up"]
```

This sequence of actions should move 'baba_obj' from its initial location [[5, 4]] to the location [[2, 4]], which is the location of 'win_word'. This should win the level. 

The explanation for this corrected action sequence is that it takes into account the movement of 'baba_obj' in the previous actions and adjusts the number of 'up' actions to get 'baba_obj' to the correct location.
