To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location. Based on the initial state and the history of previous actions, we can see that the 'baba_obj' is initially at location [[5, 4]] and the 'win_word' is at location [[2, 4]]. 

The previous actions show that moving the 'baba_obj' down and then left, we can reach the location [[2, 2]], and then moving up, we can reach the location [[2, 4]] which is the 'win_word' location. However, the previous actions also show that after reaching the 'win_word' location, the 'baba_obj' is moved up again, which changes the 'win_word' location and the 'is_word' location.

To win the level, we should not move the 'baba_obj' up after reaching the 'win_word' location. Instead, we should stop at the 'win_word' location. Based on this analysis, the corrected action sequence is:

```python
["down", "down", "left", "left", "left", "up", "up", "up"]
```

This sequence of actions will move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location without changing the 'win_word' location or the 'is_word' location, which should result in winning the level.
