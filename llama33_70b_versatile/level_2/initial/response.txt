To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the location of the 'win_word'. However, the 'baba_obj' is controlled by the 'baba_word' and can only be moved if the 'baba_word' is adjacent to it.

The initial state shows that the 'baba_obj' is at location [5, 4], the 'win_word' is at location [2, 4], and the 'baba_word' is at location [4, 7]. To move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word', we need to move the 'baba_obj' up and left.

However, the 'baba_obj' can only be moved by the 'baba_word'. So, we first need to move the 'baba_word' to be adjacent to the 'baba_obj'. Since the 'baba_word' is controlled by us (as indicated by 'controllables': ['baba_obj']), we can move the 'baba_obj' to the location of the 'baba_word' and then move it to the location of the 'win_word'.

Here is the sequence of actions to achieve this:

```python
["down", "down", "left", "left", "left", "up", "up", "up", "left", "left", "left"]
```

Explanation:
1. Move down to the location of the 'baba_word' to make it adjacent to the 'baba_obj'.
2. Move left three times to make the 'baba_obj' reach the same y-coordinate as the 'win_word'.
3. Move up three times to make the 'baba_obj' reach the same x-coordinate as the 'win_word'.
4. Move left three times to make the 'baba_obj' reach the location of the 'win_word'. 

Note that the actual movement of the 'baba_obj' will depend on the rules of the game, which are not explicitly stated in the problem description. The above solution assumes that the 'baba_obj' can be moved in the same way as the 'baba_word' once they are adjacent. 

This sequence of actions should allow us to win the level by moving the 'baba_obj' to the location of the 'win_word'. However, the actual movement may vary depending on the game rules.
