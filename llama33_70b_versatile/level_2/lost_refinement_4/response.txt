To win the level, the goal is to move the 'baba_obj' to the location of 'win_word' which is at [[2, 4]]. The 'baba_obj' starts at [[5, 4]]. 

Based on the history of previous actions and their corresponding replay buffers, the issue seems to be that the 'baba_obj' is being moved up too many times, resulting in it being moved past the 'win_word' location. 

The correct action sequence should move the 'baba_obj' down and to the left until it reaches the column of the 'win_word', and then move it up until it reaches the 'win_word' location.

```python
['down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'up', 'up']
```

This sequence of actions will move the 'baba_obj' down two spaces, then left three spaces until it is in the same column as the 'win_word', and then up two spaces until it reaches the 'win_word' location, winning the level. 

Note: The actual actions and sequence may vary based on the game's rules and mechanics which are not fully understood from the given information. The provided sequence is based on the observed behavior of the game in the given history. 

Also, note that there might be other correct sequences of actions to win the level, depending on the specific rules of the game. This is just one possible solution based on the given information. 

In this specific case, it seems that the previous attempts were very close to solving the level, but they included additional actions that moved the 'baba_obj' too far up or to the left. The corrected sequence removes these extra actions, resulting in a more direct path to the 'win_word' location. 

It's also worth noting that the 'is_word' and 'baba_word' objects seem to be having some effects on the game state, but their exact behavior is not clear from the given information. If these objects have specific rules or effects, they may need to be taken into account when planning the sequence of actions. 

Overall, the key to winning the level seems to be moving the 'baba_obj' to the correct location in a way that avoids moving it too far or getting stuck in an infinite loop. The provided sequence of actions achieves this by moving the 'baba_obj' down and to the left, and then up to the 'win_word' location.
