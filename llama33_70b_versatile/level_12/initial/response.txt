To solve this problem, we first need to understand the initial state and the goal. The goal is to win the game, which means we need to reach the 'win_word' object located at [8, 1]. We can control the 'baba_obj' object, which is initially located at [5, 4].

To reach the 'win_word' object, we need to move the 'baba_obj' object to the right until we reach the column where the 'win_word' object is located, and then move up to reach the 'win_word' object.

Here is the list of actions that will allow us to win the game:

```python
["right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:
We start by moving the 'baba_obj' object to the right three times to reach the column where the 'win_word' object is located. Then, we move up three times to reach the 'win_word' object. This sequence of actions will allow us to win the game.

Note: This solution assumes that there are no obstacles or other objects that can prevent the 'baba_obj' object from reaching the 'win_word' object. If there are obstacles, we would need to adjust the sequence of actions accordingly.
