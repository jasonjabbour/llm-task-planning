To win the level, we need to guide the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj' while avoiding the 'lava_obj' and other obstacles. From the initial state and the history of previous actions, we can see that the 'baba_obj' is initially at position [5, 4] and the 'flag_obj' is at position [4, 8]. 

The first action sequence tried to move the 'baba_obj' to the right and then up, but it ended up at position [7, 7] without reaching the 'flag_obj'. The second action sequence tried to move the 'baba_obj' up and then left, but it resulted in the 'baba_obj' being removed from the controllables and the game being lost.

From the history, we can see that the 'baba_obj' can move up and right successfully, but moving up when the 'baba_obj' is at position [5, 5] results in the game being lost because the 'baba_obj' comes into contact with the 'lava_obj'. 

Therefore, the correct action sequence should avoid moving up when the 'baba_obj' is at position [5, 5]. We can try to move the 'baba_obj' to the left first to avoid the 'lava_obj', and then move it up and right to reach the 'flag_obj'.

```python
['left', 'left', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'up']
```

This action sequence first moves the 'baba_obj' to the left to avoid the 'lava_obj', then moves it up and right to reach the 'flag_obj'. It should result in winning the game without coming into contact with the 'lava_obj' or other obstacles.
