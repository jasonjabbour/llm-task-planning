To win the level, we need to get the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj'. The 'baba_obj' is initially located at [5, 4] and the 'flag_obj' is located at [4, 8]. 

Looking at the initial state and the actions provided in the history, it seems like the goal is to navigate the 'baba_obj' around the level while avoiding the 'lava_obj' and other obstacles.

From the history, we can see that the 'baba_obj' can move to the right and up, and it seems like the 'is_word' is being used as a kind of toggle to unlock certain paths.

Here is the corrected action sequence:

```python
["up", "up", "up", "left", "left", "left", "left", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:
The provided action sequence is an attempt to get the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj'. The 'baba_obj' first moves up to avoid the 'lava_obj', then moves left to get closer to the 'flag_obj', and finally moves up again to reach the 'flag_obj'. 

This sequence is based on the observations from the history, where moving up and left seemed to be the most effective way to navigate the level. However, this is just one possible solution and may need to be adjusted based on the actual game mechanics and rules. 

Also, it is worth noting that the 'baba_word' and 'is_word' seem to be playing a role in the level, but their exact function is not entirely clear from the provided history. Further experimentation and analysis may be needed to fully understand the level and find the optimal solution. 

In addition, the 'lava_obj' and 'lava_word' seem to be obstacles that need to be avoided, and the 'melt_word' and 'win_word' may be related to the level's objective, but their exact roles are not clear from the provided information. 

Therefore, the provided action sequence is just a educated guess, and may need to be refined or adjusted as more information becomes available.
