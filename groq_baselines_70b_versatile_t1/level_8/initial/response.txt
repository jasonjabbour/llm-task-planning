To win the level, we need to navigate the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj'. The 'baba_obj' is initially located at [5, 4] and the 'flag_obj' is located at [5, 8]. We can achieve this by moving the 'baba_obj' up to reach the 'flag_obj'.

Here is the list of actions that will allow us to win the level:

```python
["up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:
We start by analyzing the initial state and identifying the locations of the 'baba_obj' and the 'flag_obj'. We notice that the 'baba_obj' is located at [5, 4] and the 'flag_obj' is located at [5, 8]. Since the 'baba_obj' is controllable, we can move it up to reach the 'flag_obj'. The 'up' action will increment the y-coordinate of the 'baba_obj' by 1, allowing us to reach the 'flag_obj' in 4 steps. By executing the sequence of 'up' actions, we can navigate the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj' and win the level. 

Note: This solution assumes that there are no obstacles or other objects that can prevent the 'baba_obj' from reaching the 'flag_obj'. In a real-world scenario, we would need to consider the presence of obstacles and adjust the action sequence accordingly.
