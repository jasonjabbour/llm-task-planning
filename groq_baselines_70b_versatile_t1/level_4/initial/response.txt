To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location. The 'baba_obj' is currently at location [2, 5] and the 'win_word' is at location [8, 8]. 

The first step is to move the 'baba_obj' to the right until it reaches the x-coordinate of the 'win_word', which is 8. Since the 'baba_obj' is currently at x-coordinate 2, we need to move it 6 steps to the right. 

Next, we need to move the 'baba_obj' up until it reaches the y-coordinate of the 'win_word', which is 8. Since the 'baba_obj' is currently at y-coordinate 5, we need to move it 3 steps up.

However, since there are obstacles in the way, such as the 'rock_obj' and the 'border', we need to move around them. We can move down to avoid the 'rock_obj' and then move up to reach the 'win_word'.

Here is the action sequence that will allow us to win the level:

```python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:
We first move the 'baba_obj' to the right 6 times to reach the x-coordinate of the 'win_word'. Then, we move it up 3 times to reach the y-coordinate of the 'win_word'. This sequence of actions will allow us to win the level. 

Note: This sequence assumes that the 'baba_obj' can move around the obstacles and reach the 'win_word' without any additional actions. If there are any additional obstacles or challenges, the sequence may need to be modified accordingly.
