To solve this level, we need to navigate the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location. Given the initial state, 'baba_obj' is located at [2, 6] and 'win_word' is at [3, 7]. The goal is to move 'baba_obj' to [3, 7] without losing the game.

Since 'baba_obj' can only move up, down, left, or right, and we have the 'directions' utility, we can calculate the required movements to reach the 'win_word' location.

First, we need to move 'baba_obj' from [2, 6] to [3, 6], which requires a 'right' move. Then, we need to move it from [3, 6] to [3, 7], which requires an 'up' move.

However, before moving up, we need to ensure that there are no obstacles in the way. The 'goop_obj' locations are [1, 6], [1, 5], [1, 4], [3, 6], [3, 5], [3, 4], [3, 3], [4, 8], [4, 7], [4, 6], [4, 5], [4, 4], [4, 3], [5, 8], [5, 7], [5, 6], [5, 5], [5, 4], [5, 3], [5, 1], [6, 5], [6, 4], [7, 5], [7, 4], [8, 5], [8, 4]. Since [3, 6] is a 'goop_obj' location, we need to move it out of the way first. We can move the 'goop_obj' at [3, 6] to the left by moving 'baba_obj' to the left and pushing the 'goop_obj'.

So, the correct sequence of actions would be to move 'baba_obj' to the right, then move it down to [3, 5], then move it left to [2, 5], then move it up to [2, 6], then move it right to [3, 6], then move it up to [3, 7].

But we can simplify the above sequence by first moving 'baba_obj' to the right to [3, 6], then moving it down is not needed so we can move it up to [3, 7] directly but the 'goop_obj' is at [3, 6] so first we need to move 'baba_obj' to the right to [3, 6] then move 'goop_obj' to the left by moving 'baba_obj' to the left then we can move 'baba_obj' to the right then up.

But the above sequence does not seem to solve the problem correctly because the 'goop_obj' cannot be moved out of the way with the above sequence.

Let's try another approach. We can move 'baba_obj' to the right to [3, 6], then move it down to [4, 6] (but [4, 6] is also 'goop_obj'), then we are stuck.

However, we have 'empty' cells at [2, 5], [2, 4], [2, 3], [2, 2], [3, 2], [4, 2], [5, 2], [6, 8], [6, 7], [6, 6], [6, 3], [6, 2], [6, 1], [7, 8], [7, 6], [7, 2], [7, 1], [8, 8], [8, 7], [8, 6], [8, 2], [8, 1].

The 'baba_obj' is at [2, 6]. If we try to move it up to [2, 7] or [2, 8], it will be out of bounds.

So we have two options to move 'baba_obj', either to the right to [3, 6] or down to [3, 6]. 

But we cannot move it to the right because [3, 6] is occupied by 'goop_obj'. 

So let's move it down to [3, 6] but [3, 6] is also occupied by 'goop_obj'. 

However, we see 'is_word' and 'rock_word' and 'you_word' and 'win_word' and 'push_word' and 'sink_word'. These might have some effect on the game when some 'obj' interacts with them.

So if we move 'baba_obj' down to [3, 6] (but [3, 6] is 'goop_obj'), we are stuck.

But let's analyze this problem again.

The 'baba_obj' is at [2, 6].

We have a 'baba_word' at [1, 8].

We have a 'goop_word' at [1, 3].

If we try to move 'baba_obj' up to [2, 7] or [2, 8], we have a 'baba_word' at [1, 8]. 

So we can try to move 'baba_obj' to the left to [1, 6]. 

When 'baba_obj' interacts with 'baba_word', 'baba_obj' becomes 'you'.

However, since we have a 'goop_obj' at [1, 6], we are stuck.

But let's think about it again.

We have a 'baba_obj' at [2, 6].

If we move it to the right to [3, 6], we are stuck because [3, 6] is also 'goop_obj'.

But let's analyze this problem again.

We have a 'baba_word' at [1, 8].

We have a 'goop_word' at [1, 3].

We have an 'is_word' at [1, 2], [2, 8], [2, 7], [3, 1].

If we move 'baba_obj' to the right to [3, 6], we are stuck.

But if we move 'baba_obj' up to [2, 7] and then to the left to [1, 7], we have a 'flag_word' at [1, 7].

However, we have a 'flag_obj' at [7, 7].

If we move 'baba_obj' up to [2, 7] and then to the right to [3, 7], we have a 'win_word' at [3, 7].

So this seems like the correct sequence of actions.

Here is the correct sequence of actions:

```python
["up", "right"]
```

Explanation:
The correct sequence of actions is to move 'baba_obj' up to [2, 7] and then move it to the right to [3, 7]. This sequence of actions will allow 'baba_obj' to interact with the 'win_word' and win the game.
