To determine the sequence of actions that will allow us to win the level, we must analyze the given state and understand the goal. The objective is to reach the 'win_word' location, which is at position [8, 1]. Given that we can only control the 'baba_obj' and it is initially at position [5, 4], we need to navigate it to the 'win_word' location.

The 'baba_obj' needs to move from its initial position to the position of the 'win_word'. Since the 'baba_obj' is controllable and can move up, down, left, or right, we will plan a path from its current location [5, 4] to [8, 1].

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the path:
- Move right from [5, 4] to [6, 4], then to [7, 4], and to [8, 4].
- Then move down from [8, 4] to [8, 3], to [8, 2], and finally to [8, 1].

Given the action space, the movements can be represented as follows:

```python
["right", "right", "right", "down", "down", "down"]
```

Explanation:
This sequence of actions will guide the 'baba_obj' from its initial position [5, 4] to the position of the 'win_word' [8, 1], which is the objective of the level. By moving right three times and then down three times, the 'baba_obj' will reach the 'win_word' location, thus winning the level.
