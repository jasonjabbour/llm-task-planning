To win the level, the goal is to move the 'baba_obj' to the location of 'win_word', which is [[8, 8]]. 

The current location of 'baba_obj' is [[2, 5]]. To reach the target location, we need to move it right and up.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:
- The 'baba_obj' starts at [2, 5].
- We need to move it to the right to reach the column of the 'win_word', which is column 8.
- Then, we need to move it up to reach the row of the 'win_word', which is row 8.

Now, let's generate the sequence of actions.


### Actions
```python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

### Explanation
The sequence of actions is composed of moving 'baba_obj' to the right to reach the column of the 'win_word', and then moving it up to reach the row of the 'win_word'. This sequence of actions will result in winning the level because it successfully navigates 'baba_obj' to the location of 'win_word'. 

Note that this solution assumes that there are no obstacles or other objects that could prevent 'baba_obj' from reaching the 'win_word'. However, based on the provided state, there are no obstacles that would prevent 'baba_obj' from moving to the 'win_word'.
