To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the location of the 'flag_obj'. The 'baba_obj' is currently at location [2, 2] and the 'flag_obj' is at location [5, 5]. 

The goal is to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj' by navigating through the empty spaces. Since we can only move up, down, left, or right, we need to find a path that avoids the 'rock_obj' and other obstacles.

The path to the 'flag_obj' can be found by moving right from the current location of the 'baba_obj' until we reach the x-coordinate of the 'flag_obj', then moving up to reach the y-coordinate of the 'flag_obj'.

Here are the steps to win the level:

### Actions
```python
["right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up"]
```

### Explanation
We start at the location [2, 2] and move right until we reach the x-coordinate of the 'flag_obj' at [5, 2]. Then we move up until we reach the y-coordinate of the 'flag_obj' at [5, 5]. This sequence of actions will allow us to win the level by moving the 'baba_obj' to the location of the 'flag_obj'. 

Note that this is one possible solution and there might be other valid sequences of actions that can lead to winning the level.
