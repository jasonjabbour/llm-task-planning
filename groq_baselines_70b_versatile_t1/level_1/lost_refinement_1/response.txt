To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given state and history of actions to determine the best course of action to win the level. 

The goal is to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location at [[8, 8]]. 

From the initial state, the 'baba_obj' is located at [[2, 4]]. 

To reach the 'win_word', we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the right until we reach the 'win_word' location.

Based on the provided history, we can see that moving the 'baba_obj' to the right will move it to the next location.

We should also be careful not to move the 'baba_obj' into a location that is not empty.

```python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]
```

This sequence of actions will move the 'baba_obj' from its initial location to the 'win_word' location, which should win the level.

Note that this solution assumes that there are no obstacles or other objects that can block the 'baba_obj' from moving to the 'win_word' location. If there are obstacles, a more complex solution would be needed to navigate around them. 

Also, the actual implementation might need additional logic to handle edge cases, such as when the 'baba_obj' is at the edge of the grid and cannot move further in a certain direction. 

The provided utils dictionary can be useful in implementing the movement logic, as it defines the directions for each action. 

For example, to move the 'baba_obj' to the right, we can use the 'right' direction from the utils dictionary: 

```python
directions = {'left': [-1, 0], 'right': [1, 0], 'up': [0, 1], 'down': [0, -1]}
baba_obj_x, baba_obj_y = 2, 4
new_x, new_y = baba_obj_x + directions['right'][0], baba_obj_y + directions['right'][1]
```
