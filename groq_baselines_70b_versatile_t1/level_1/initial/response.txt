To win the level, we need to guide the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj'. Since the 'baba_obj' is located at [2, 4] and the 'flag_obj' is located at [7, 4], we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the right until it reaches the 'flag_obj'.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Move the 'baba_obj' down to [2, 3] to avoid any potential obstacles.
2. Move the 'baba_obj' right until it reaches [7, 3].
3. Move the 'baba_obj' down to [7, 4] to reach the 'flag_obj'.

Using the given action space and the directions provided in the utils, we can create the following action sequence:

```python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]
```

Explanation:
This action sequence will guide the 'baba_obj' to the 'flag_obj', thus winning the level. Note that this sequence assumes that there are no obstacles between the 'baba_obj' and the 'flag_obj'. If there are obstacles, additional actions may be necessary to navigate around them. However, based on the provided state, it appears that the path is clear. 

Also, the above sequence does not consider the 'you_word', 'win_word', 'is_word' objects, and their potential impact on the game state, as their behavior is not clearly defined in the given information. If these objects have specific rules or behaviors associated with them, additional actions or modifications to the sequence may be necessary.
