To solve this level, we need to guide the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location. Based on the initial state and the history of previous actions, we can see that the 'baba_obj' can be moved up, down, left, or right.

The initial location of 'baba_obj' is [[2, 4]], and the 'win_word' is at [[8, 8]]. Since 'baba_obj' can only be controlled to move in the four main directions (up, down, left, right), we need to move it to the right and up to reach the 'win_word' location.

Here's the corrected action sequence:

```python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

This action sequence moves the 'baba_obj' six steps to the right and four steps up, which should guide it to the 'win_word' location at [[8, 8]]. 

Note that this is a simplified solution and does not take into account any potential obstacles or complications that may arise during the movement. 

Also, note that the provided history does not include the solution, it just shows how the 'baba_obj' moved in previous attempts. 

This solution assumes that there are no obstacles in the path to the 'win_word' and the 'baba_obj' can move freely in the four main directions. 

In a real-world scenario, we would need to consider the full state of the level, including any obstacles, and adjust the action sequence accordingly. 

Here is the updated code for finding the path:

```python
def find_path(state):
    # Define the possible movements
    movements = {
        'up': [0, 1],
        'down': [0, -1],
        'left': [-1, 0],
        'right': [1, 0]
    }

    # Get the initial location of the 'baba_obj'
    baba_obj = state['baba_obj'][0]

    # Get the location of the 'win_word'
    win_word = state['win_word'][0]

    # Calculate the differences in x and y coordinates
    dx = win_word[0] - baba_obj[0]
    dy = win_word[1] - baba_obj[1]

    # Create the action sequence
    actions = []
    if dx > 0:
        actions.extend(['right'] * dx)
    elif dx < 0:
        actions.extend(['left'] * abs(dx))
    if dy > 0:
        actions.extend(['up'] * dy)
    elif dy < 0:
        actions.extend(['down'] * abs(dy))

    return actions
