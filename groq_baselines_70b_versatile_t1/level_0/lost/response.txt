I understand the problem.

Based on the given state and action space, here is my proposed action sequence to win the level:

**Actions:**

```python
["right", "left", "right", "up", "left", "down", "right", "down"]
```

**Explanation:**

Upon examining the state, I noticed that there is a 'baba_obj' at position [2, 4] which is one of the controllable objects. The goal is to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' position [8, 8]. 

1. Initially, move the 'baba_obj' to the right to position [2, 5]. This is achieved by taking the "right" action.
2. Then, move the 'baba_obj' to the left to position [2, 4]. This is achieved by taking the "left" action.
3. Next, move the 'baba_obj' to the right to position [3, 4]. This is achieved by taking the "right" action.
4. Move the 'baba_obj' up to position [2, 5]. This is achieved by taking the "up" action.
5. Then, move the 'baba_obj' to the left to position [2, 4]. This is achieved by taking the "left" action.
6. Next, move the 'baba_obj' down to position [3, 4]. This is achieved by taking the "down" action.
7. Finally, move the 'baba_obj' down to position [4, 4], then [5, 4], and so on, until it reaches the 'win_word' position [8, 8]. This is achieved by taking the "down" action repeatedly.

By executing these actions, the 'baba_obj' will reach the 'win_word' position, allowing the player to win the level.

Please note that this solution assumes that the actions are applied in the order given and that the game allows the 'baba_obj' to move to any adjacent space.
