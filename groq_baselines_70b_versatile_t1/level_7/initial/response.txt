To solve this level, we need to navigate through the given state to reach the 'win_word' location. Given the initial state and the action space, we will analyze the positions of relevant objects to determine the best path to the 'win_word' location at [8, 1].

First, let's identify the starting point. Since 'controllables' is empty, we assume the starting point is where we have control, which might not be explicitly stated but can be inferred from the given objects' positions. 

Given that 'baba_obj' is at [3, 4], 'keke_obj' is at [3, 7], and 'flag_obj' is at [5, 4], and our goal is to reach 'win_word' at [8, 1], we need to find a path that avoids obstacles and utilizes the empty spaces effectively. 

However, without a clear indication of our starting position or the exact movement rules (e.g., can we move over words or objects?), we'll make an assumption for the sake of providing a solution: We'll assume our controllable object starts at a position that allows us to move towards the 'win_word', and we can move through empty spaces without restrictions.

Our goal is to move from our assumed starting position to [8, 1]. Since we don't have a clear starting point, let's consider a general approach to reaching [8, 1] from anywhere within the grid, assuming we can move in the four main directions.

Given the constraints and the goal, a possible sequence of actions could involve moving right and down, considering the grid layout and the goal position. However, without knowing our exact starting position or any movement restrictions (e.g., moving over other words), we'll propose a sequence that generally makes sense for navigating a grid from a higher position to a lower one and from left to right.

For example, if we start at a position that allows us to move down and right without restrictions, a simplified approach could involve:

```python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "down", "down", "down", "down", "down", "down", "down", "down"]
```

Explanation:
This sequence is a simplistic approach assuming we start from the left side of the grid and need to reach the right side, then move down. It doesn't take into account obstacles or the exact starting position, which are crucial for a precise solution. Given the information and the constraints, a more tailored approach would require knowledge of the starting position and specific movement rules within the game. The provided sequence is a general attempt to illustrate how one might conceptually approach moving towards a goal in a grid-based environment. 

However, please note, without clear rules on movement (e.g., can we move over objects or words?), starting position, or controllable objects, providing an accurate sequence of actions is challenging. This response aims to demonstrate a thought process rather than offer a definitive solution. 

Given the complexity and lack of specific rules, a more detailed analysis of the game environment and its rules would be necessary to provide a precise action sequence.
