To solve this problem, we need to understand the game state and the objectives. The game state is represented by various objects and their locations on a grid, along with a set of controllable objects. The primary objective here seems to be to use the controllable object ('baba_obj') to interact with other objects in a way that transitions the game to a won state.

Given the action space consists of 'up', 'down', 'left', and 'right' movements, we'll need to use these to navigate the 'baba_obj' (currently at [5, 4]) to a position where it can trigger a win condition. The 'win_word' is at [2, 4], and 'is_word' objects are at [2, 5] and [5, 7]. The 'you_word' is at [6, 7], and the 'baba_word' is at [4, 7].

The goal seems to involve aligning the 'baba_obj' with the 'win_word' or creating a path that connects 'baba_obj' to 'win_word' through the 'is_word' objects, considering the other objects' positions and their potential interactions. However, without specific rules on how these objects interact or how the 'won' condition is triggered beyond their positions, we'll have to make an educated guess based on the given setup.

Assuming moving the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location ([2, 4]) directly or to a position where it can influence the 'win_word' through the 'is_word' objects could trigger a win, we'd need to navigate the 'baba_obj' from [5, 4] to [2, 4] or an adjacent 'is_word' object.

To move from [5, 4] to [2, 4], the 'baba_obj' needs to move left three times. However, we must verify that moving in such a manner does not violate any game rules or run into an object that it cannot pass through.

### Actions:
```python
["left", "left", "left"]
```

### Explanation:
This sequence attempts to move the 'baba_obj' directly to the 'win_word' location. It's a straightforward approach assuming the 'baba_obj' can move through or to the 'win_word' location and that such movement is enough to trigger the 'won' condition. Without more detailed rules on object interactions, this is a simple, direct attempt to align the controllable object with the win condition. More complex interactions or rules might require a different strategy, potentially involving navigating around obstacles or leveraging the 'is_word' objects in a more sophisticated way. 

Please note, due to the lack of explicit interaction rules between game objects, this solution is based on a basic interpretation of the game state and objectives. Additional information about how objects interact or how the 'won' condition is precisely triggered could necessitate a revised approach.
