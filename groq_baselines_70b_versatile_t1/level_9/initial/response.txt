To win the level, we need to move the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location. The 'baba_obj' is currently at location [2, 5] and the 'win_word' is at location [8, 1].

First, we need to move the 'baba_obj' down to reach the 'win_word'. However, there are obstacles in the way, including 'skull_obj' and 'empty' spaces that we need to navigate through.

Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. Move 'baba_obj' down to [2, 4] to avoid the 'skull_word' and 'is_word' obstacles.
2. Move 'baba_obj' right to [3, 4], [4, 4], [5, 4], [6, 4], [7, 4], and [8, 4] to reach the column where the 'win_word' is located.
3. Move 'baba_obj' down to [8, 3], [8, 2], and finally [8, 1] to reach the 'win_word' location.

```python
["down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "down", "down", "down"]
```

This action sequence will allow us to navigate the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location, avoiding obstacles and empty spaces along the way, and thus winning the level.

Explanation:

* The initial state provides the locations of all objects and words on the board, including the 'baba_obj' and the 'win_word'.
* The 'baba_obj' can be controlled and moved in the four main directions (up, down, left, right) using the provided action space.
* By analyzing the board layout and the locations of the obstacles and empty spaces, we can plan a path for the 'baba_obj' to reach the 'win_word' location.
* The provided action sequence is the result of this planning, taking into account the need to avoid obstacles and empty spaces while moving the 'baba_obj' to the 'win_word' location.
